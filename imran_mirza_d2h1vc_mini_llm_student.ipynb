        "Bigram models are a type of statistical language model used for predicting the likelihood of a word based on the occurrence of its preceding word in a sequence. These models assume that the probability of a word depends only on the previous word, capturing local dependencies in the data. Bigram models are simple but effective, commonly used in tasks like text generation, machine translation, and information retrieval. However, they have limitations in handling long-range dependencies and contextual nuances compared to more advanced models like neural language models."
