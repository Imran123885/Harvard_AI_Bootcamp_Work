            "i have been with petronas for years i feel that petronas has performed well and made a huge profit i do feel that running is a divine experience and that i can expect to have some type of spiritual encounter i have immense sympathy with the general point but as a possible proto writer trying to find time to write in the corners of life and with no sign of an agent let alone a publishing contract this feels a little precious i do not feel reassured anxiety is on each side i have the feeling she was amused and delighted i was able to help chai lifeline with your support and encouragement is a great feeling and i am so glad you were able to help me i feel more superior dead chicken or grieving child i get giddy over feeling elegant in a perfectly fitted pencil skirt i can t imagine a real life scenario where i would be emotionally connected enough with someone to feel totally accepted and safe where it it morally acceptable for me to have close and prolonged physical contact and where sex won t be expected subsequently i am not sure what would make me feel content if anything i have been feeling the need to be creative i do however want you to know that if something someone is causing you to feel less then your splendid self step away from them i need you i need someone i need to be protected and feel safe i am small now i find myself in a season of no words i plan to share my everyday life stories traveling adventures inspirations and handmade creations with you and hope you will also feel inspired i already have my christmas trees up i got two and am feeling festive which i m sure is spurring me to get started on this book ive worn it once on its own with a little concealer and for the days im feeling brave but dont want to be pale then its perfect i feel very strongly passionate about when some jerk off decides to poke and make fun of us i lost my special mind but don t worry i m still sane i just wanted you to feel what i felt while reading this book i don t know how many times it was said that sam was special but i can guarantee you it was many more times than what i used in that paragraph did i tell you she was special on a boat trip to denmark i need to feel the dough to make sure its just perfect i bag qaf look who s cryin now jacynthe lookin good feelin gorgeous rupaul the skins scissor sisters valentine the sun fed up kayle who s your daddy gerling awake the unkind u i have this feeling that if i have anymore vigorous sexual activity in the coming yes i misspelt that as cumming days parts of me will begin to fall off i feel my mom s graceful warm loving smile as i rob the time to nurture myself and heal i feel in they talk the brother in law is extremely popular the one that had no me to think is so stiff i was feeling brave when i bought it and clearly when i was doing my makeup i don t necessarily think f bombs and sex are necessary in all stories but i feel reassured when i see them in print journals i did successfully manage to stretch a mxm canvas i feel that this is an achievement in itself for me and was a worthwhile usage of my money and time i will use the canvas for future briefs i think feelings are one of nay the most important things we have i feel completely honored to be an influence to this young talented fully alive beautiful girl woman i feel very happy and excited since i learned so many things i feel that at shows and around show horses people are trusting and relaxed because most show horses are safe and quiet and are handled frequently i only have a couple of things left to make and at the start of december i am done and feeling smug i think about how u could make me feel and realize that everything will be ok im starting to feel wryly amused at the banal comedy of errors my life is turning into i find every body beautiful and only want people to feel vital in their bodies i alba i feel good and im fitting in i feel excited about what im doing again i feel like i have a ton of catching up to do i also know how good it feels to look back and see that i honored my word and that helps from the start i feel like things are getting a little overwhelming a few spritz of this toner really helps calm and soothe me i hope that you realize how such little effort is required to make a person feel better about themselves or their situation whether its me a family member a college or high school friend a neighbor down the street or even a complete stranger i am feeling so festive today that i m even going to put the tree up as soon as i ve finished doing this and catching up with the week s goings ons on coronation street finding out that i am not ill not seriously i feel it rarely advances any worthwhile cause and i always stick to the rule of not posting anything online that i wouldnt be prepared to say to somebodys face i am feeling all useful i dance i should feel pretty i workout every morning before and feel fabulous for it i was feeling fabulous until friday morning when i started to get these awful cramps at work i feel honoured to have been able to call them friends to share their brotherhood i feel they are pretty safe on my blog img src http s i feel pretty eager to get it done as i have a fun plan for quilting it i left to the shower questioning what i feel she was gorgeous such a fantastic body so confident in her movement effortlessly graceful i feel energetic and bouncy i m more than happy to go to the gym run around outside with my kids or take the pram for a long walk often i do all three in one day i was still feeling strong i didn t burst into tears or some other devastating release of feelings or thoughts because i seemed to know that rich also had to go through his own space without me just dumping on him i clench to the corners of the bed to feel assured i might go get a car wash if i am feeling really generous my car needs it i am bloging again i am sitting here feeling content with my dogs amp cat etc and i know that how lucky we are the truth is we i was feeling quite mellow and i wanted a soft easy look to wear with my beginning of a cold i still feel it does the genre a disservice when stories are resolved artifically i always know when i am feeling artistic when i write my name while i am in an artistic mood the i in manitz i draw a circle not a dot the bigger the dot the more artistic i am feeling and if it is just a line like an accent mark in spanish im pissed i feel ive got my foot in the door of the fantastic world of walking and running the trails fells and mountains i have a feeling my view isnt going to be very popular and thats fine i want to feel valued i do and appreciated i do and know the people who love me arent going anywhere even if the nature of the relationship changes i use it regularly with relaxing music and always feel invigorated afterward i feel like its perfect a w see youtube has its influences i even know trends ive lost some weight such that i could fit into a tiny skirt that ive been unable to wear because i didnt feel confident in it until now i hope to feel a bit more creative again soon and miss its presence in my life blog i begin to feel complacent with my life here i remember feeling inspired and thinking that it was a fine example of parenting i really feel that my life is perfect right now and if it isnt too much to ask for i just hope that everything would stay the same im there i simply feel contented im not saying cut everyone out of your life but i feel its important to find comfort in solitude meditation or working on projects alone i feel honored by it i feel im like a bird flying in the air in a very carefree manner i feel that educating families and supporting and educationg mamas and papas is key i have always liked to use the original fragrance to freshen up and lightly scent my underwear drawer to feel gorgeously glamorous and girly i feel like i talented young man i don t feel talented then i don t to work with i feel the reason were apart of each others lives is because im in his to help him become something to push him to succeed and be successful and happy i feel pretty mellow so far about whatever healing wounding process may be getting underway i feel as a child innocent feelings illustrating a ive worked really hard all year to try to make each child in the class feel like they are valued i still second guess myself and still have a terrible time making definitive decisions but there are certain truths that i do know about myself and i feel assured by those truths i don t feel like eggs benedict i ll have something equally delicious im feeling my way through and trusting myself im feeling inspired by all the summery elements of my favorite past time beach bummin i can feel that she smiled i love you even more gorgeous i make an arcade i have a very simple purpose and that is to try to make it feel absolutely comfortable physically emotionally practically and absolutely i was feeling over eager and hopped on to the tube to ride the eye of london i want to feel safe and well and that maybe just maybe theres a small chance my i can feel joy and my dreams can come true i also think it is puzzling that after this particular administrator has singled me out for praise on my ability to get my students to read that he feels that ssr time is not a productive use of class time i hope i feel mellow well fed well slept at peace with myself within this external world i feel very relaxed and fine i go to sleep i feel as if i m giving up precious time to do something else with my life i feel like i ve been neglecting my beloved mom blog i shalt say we did cos i din feel a thing when he wrote hw he is keen on xxx im hesitant to make suggestions because i feel as if the outcome would not be sincere i was that i bombed that first interview i left the second interview feeling pretty fan freaking tastic i think its kind of taken us this long to build up a good inventory of sauces oils spices and other non perishables to feel like we have a chance at making something delicious without having to specifically go out and buy every single item in a recipe i now feel i can advise other dads whose children will soon become teenagers it s not cool to pull up to your kid s high school to pick them up in a smelly jalopy with plants coming out the windows i would feel lucky to call any of the materials and kits on your site mine they are just beautifully curated i am so festive this feels so delicious wheeeeee what a great night i feel like i almost convinced myself this is going to be the pattern i mainly like to text because i feel like i am so much more clever with the written word rather than the spoken i seriouly feel i am not being respected i dont have my privacy i am being ordered around i said in the words of a devotee that i feel relieved when i hear the your title as deen bandhu as i am the most fallen person but i become afraid at your title of uplifter of devotees as i don t consider myself to be a true devotee and hence unworthy to benefit from the aspect of your personality i guess i would feel more like joseph with walt trusting me to care for mother and over the finances which he did six months before he died there are times i want to defend my self but god makes me be quiet i feel excelent but sometimes theres just nothing to do especially since im not really keen on video games anymore i watch a bit of anime and some movies but theres just got to be more in my life i wonder if this is what master is feeling i am r wanting and eager to please and i am master who could very much enjoy his my attentions but won t because it is wrong as i he has no desire to return his my affections im feeling a little bit more positive now as things were quite hard at first as my savings were eaten up quickly with costs and i didnt want to become a burden to my boyfriend but weve come out the other end and im feeling brighter and more inspired about things to come i do feel a shift in me to being more positive i am feeling brave enough i feel clever nov i finally left feeling judged and ridiculed because i am intelligent i was so honoured that this young woman felt comfortable enough to ask me i had kind of a faux hawk thing going on back then so i must have looked dykey enough for her to feel safe talking to me i feel convinced plus so many diverse price tags that i feel sure everyone should come up with the funds to have their plot to be lighted up relatively economically im feeling font friendly i had my hand on my beads consciously breathing consciously working to feel calm about my list of things to accomplish that afternoon i love wearing new shoes i just feel so glamourous and when i get a pair of designer shoes i love the box and all the trimmings that come with them i just love the feeling of something warmly hugging you and feeling so precious and small precious to someone something im feeling far more mellow than normal i became more dismayed as i studied what people were wearing and started feeling like though some of the outfits were gorgeous they were bought that way i dont want to wax them off and draw them in or anything i just need to not have a unibrow and maybe get rid of the few spare hairs creeping down toward my eyelid if im feeling brave im feeling lucky width li style border px list style outside margin px px i woke up feeling confident and watched the bodypump dvd to gather some coaching tips and compulsory cues i am beginning to feel that theres a good chance i might pass i feel like i have a little more control and can help sweet pea better if i know what is ahead i feel it is worthwhile to document it for people who are not familiar with batch files i and i are feeling especially thankful for so many small blessings in our life right now i am hoping the weatherman is right with his forecast of stay at home dont venture out rain for tomorrow i am feeling all kind of creative i have learnt nothing else in the last two years it is that it s best to feel my way by trusting my instincts i am feeling is also a blossoming eager anxiety im not feeling the outfit but the heels are gorgeous i feel that the session was useful and gave me tools i need to move forward in my life i feel so tranquil right now its great i will go to my mailbox and talk to the mailman then the grocery clerk etc but no matter how small the step or how limited the risk a complete and total willingness to experience whatever thoughts feelings and sensations emerge is important i feel like this insecurity is a good thing when i first started writing i pictured it all ill get round to it this quarter im feeling hopeful about this one i feel absolutely fantastic and i hope baby does too i watched the snow fall and accumulate on the conifer trees while i was shoveling in my shirt sleeves and feeling vigorous i have a feeling that your father already convinced him of that i play in the rain squeal with glee at the feeling of mud squishing between my toes and enjoy pretty much anything that takes place outdoors i am feeling humorous i put cold callers on hold i feel very privileged but it is also a lot of work im pretty happy but a little on the nauseated side to feel thrilled i feel like im putting an innocent man on death row i wasn t sure what else to do to help her feel smart i feel is thankful for the lessons i m learning i hope you can feel glad that she gave you so many things including memories that you can cherish i feel some of my projects are clever and useful enough i figured i would start sharing them on instructables so i wrote my first one this weekend im not scared at all anymore im fine i feel terrific about the surgery i may or may not have cried when thanking them for making my children feel so special and loved i feel like i ve been welcomed a tight knit family who ll make sure i won t feel alone ever i usually use smaller legos however this year i have a few students with fine motor delays and i want all my students to feel successful i get some exercise and feel like im doing something worthwhile in the meantime i feel like my life is very rich and fulfilling but i know people look at the way i live and feel some misplaced pity for me im feeling happy and well i got the feeling brig is sincere and has a very strong desire to help others become successful both financially and also through building strengthening relationships through christianity i were feeling energetic so we decided we were going to bike to the rest of the temples i am happpy when i get good results in the field of academics or athletics id pop out of the chair feeling like i should be doing something more worthwhile i was really hoping that theyd get far enough ahead of us that we could feel like we were doing our own navigating so i was delighted when after punching the second control they headed off onto a trail through the woods i feel very comfortable with this decision i didnt feel that welcomed when i first entered morris quickly changed that and i left feeling very happy i feel so honoured to have hosted this series to have such talented a i feel after reading allthingsbucks blog which brought tears to my eyes and a lump in my throat and a feeling of not having a worthwhile thing to be upset about that i shouldnt write such a lame blog i was feeling determined it didnt take long for me to start nomming on naughty stuff again i feel honored to be with many wonderful artists and to display my work for the public to see i just remember being so fully stressed out and while i had fun i feel it could have been more lively im not only thankful that everything seems to be working out as i wrap week at my new job but also feeling pretty lucky to have the people we do in our lives i knew it was the holy spirit at work plus it feels divine in the gooooood way like a massage reassuring me i feel as though ive reached a point in my career where im highly respected there ive had a lot of good days where i feel fabulous and have lots of energy but lately ive also had some bad days where i feel gigantic and slow and clumsy i didnt get a wink of sleep that night and continued feeling not so fabulous the next morning i love sliding down on a nice big throbbing cock and feeling what my gorgeous body does to a man im definitely feeling festive i am feeling super excited as the weeks seem to be flying by and we are getting closer and closer to our due date i have turned that page i feel like there is no way of getting back my irresponcible years of carefree college i am feeling more energetic more alive happier than i have in a long time i feel a world class player in the benzema mould would be fantastic i am not working out the amount i would like to i feel like my lifestyle change has been successful so far i love the porn industry and i feel satisfied and fulfilled working in it i have to say that it doesn t really bring in the big bucks i overhear the victory tune on some geeks ringtone i feel triumphant i feel very passionate about a certain topic i love backing up my position with actual knowledge and facts instead of relying solely on opinions i woke up the morning of our hike feeling jubilant i feel like a little kid whose mom is proud that they touched the soccer ball once during the game i feel incredibly charmed that i have these people in my life and that i am at such an exciting amazing chapter of things i know those feelings stem from this part of me that is not accepted mainstream more importantly in the communities to which i seek belongingness i really like how the special edition really does feel special with songs on it i feel your innocent love i feel like having that sweet carby yet low glycemic meal not just at breakfast but often for dessert i feel safe encoding utf locale en isprivate false ismobile false mobileclass isprivateblog false languagedirection ltr feedlinks link rel alternate type application atom xml title i could use a standing ovation could you i really lose a lot of my nesting homemaking instinct and desire when i am pregnant and the longer im pregnant the worse it gets though i do get about a month reprieve where i feel creative again around the six month mark and youll notice that is when i did a post for halloween i feel as if this opportunity to return to moz is gods gracious gracious way of giving me that heat desire despite my own self doubt and uncertainty in the past i feel really lucky to have found you as a resource and have always felt the answers i needed were there for the asking i keep running up the hill and fitness wise feel fine but along with my foot my calves are starting to now hurt also as they begin to tire i supposed i ought to feel thankful for that adding with a sarcastic edge at my age i love comments so feel free to post one i truly feel that they do a lot of positive things to help the conditions for the workers and their families kids i feel hes being very casual with my entire future i was still feeling strong but i missed a couple lifts i checked on you was a long time ago i can say you were happy way back then feeling contented with everyone and everything around you i write him when something big has happened like a fun trip or milestone and other times i just write him to tell him how im feeling about his sweet baby snuggles or growing personality i hate the expectation that i must need a man in my life to feel worthwhile or valued im afraid im in an environment that makes me feel more relaxed cause i have been feeling conflicted on whether or not i as a follower of christ should celebrate the ever popular pagan originated modern day holidays i feel carefree and weightless and yet worried and grounded all at the same time i feel he is sincere and repentant for his past opposition to civil rights i only have a few things on my list i feel super guilty and can t relax i feel like i am really valuable to him i still wake up every morning feeling so blessed to be here and unable to believe im lucky enough to be able to call this amazing family mine for life i got a feeling by the look in her eyes that she was sincere i feel assured that my mind is not one i am so feeling so rich and yup i know i am so blessed i cant believe the moment where i feel the most useful is when im washing the dishes i admire athleticism i feel like i would be more entertained if i got to watch severely out of shape people participate in olympic events i know that i will never see this place again and that would break my heart had not a thick layer of moss encased it in a thick shell muffling all other sharper feelings pleasant or painful i am a nameless mid s bottom law school graduate who finds himself marginally attached and awash in a sea of overeducated but underpaid indentured peers who feel and were duped by the promise of a better life through debt and modern chemistry i truly feel what you all contribute to the blog world especially with regard to educating writers is so valuable i feel like it would be too clever and get into a ton of things all the time i know shes right because i feel more energetic awake patient and happy when im running daily but i still feel a little bad too because i believe breast milk is so much better for babies than formula i feel so honored that students come to my classes i get an anxious feeling i feel xox soon itll be the real thing already so i need to be flawless i feel very rich very blessed very joyful im feeling rather pleased with myself tonight because i did that i feel so carefree nowwwwww i was sick with a cold amp not feeling well wondering if i would even be able to have the patience to go to whitleys month photo shoot i want to have a job where i am permanent and where i feel like i am valued i care about someones emotional spiritual and intellectual progress to the point where i feel like i should exert myself in that progress and its important to me that is love i will actually feel comfortable speaking to others in just japanese i feel pretty happy about my current progress i like keeping a record of my life in written form and pictures and i feel like that is even more important now that i have baby i feel more than honoured to be part of this series and join all these wonderful and talented ladies in a celebration of the womanhood i feel more confident about this team right now than i did four hours ago i feel have a fabulous birding weekend everyone i feel the language of the warning is pretty benign but i am open to your suggestions on how to improve it i suddenly feel a lot smarter and more talented than i did last night i get into what it actually does i feel like everyone should buy it just because it smells amazing i feel as though i cant bear the motion of quilting it even though the idea of it delighted me so only a few days ago i refers of course though i cant help feeling somehow ironically in retrospect to loudons son with kate mcgarrigle the rather talented himself rufus wainwright i feel like i captured all his sweet looks i feel like i need cute pictures to share i do not feel comfortable staying in my house i feel relentless when im asked to do something tired almost all the time and bored without my own money i guess im feeling generous today and so i have decided to offer a fabulous deal on of my most popular prints at the moment i am feeling really carefree and today was really carefree i asked him what was making him feel so fabulous and he said i m healthy my family is healthy and we live in a free country i woke up feeling incredibly content amp optimistic today however i woke up with a terrible cold and a complete lack of energy i feel that gulam ali is even more talented than many other classical singers i be the go to guy for someone who wants a genuine guy who would treat them right and spend quality time with them and make them feel special i would feel differently if i believed that the leaders were perfectly truthful i feel like its important to reveal lessons youve learned in tough times along with ones youve learned in awesome times when you are endeavoring to build an audience through honesty and authenticity i said i feel incredibly thankful on the whole i feel inspired and eager to press on when the sun shines im just hoping i can walk by then because my thighs are not feeling at all friendly today i find this scent pretty generic i actually feel like bath amp bodyworks didnt invest much time in this collection like they created sweet on paris then decided to throw together two other predictable scents i like the person i have become because i feel so much more carefree and liberated but at the same time i dont recognize myself im feeling fine im feeling quite pleased this week i feel privileged to have narrated erik princes autobiography civilian warriors the inside story of blackwater and the unsung heroes of the war on terror which will be released this monday nov th i am feeling hopeful and looking forward once again i feel so comfortable around him i feel privileged having the opportunity to be a part of it all ive been coursing through cycles of happiness to a feeling of being mellow to a feeling of being really depressed to being mellow again and then back to the beginning i probably couldn t go back to washington permanently once the baby is here at least not for a while although i have been torn for a while about whether i want to yes bleu i know how you feel about this but i m still not completely convinced i have a feeling hell be a casual favorite if blue or red are heavy colors at your casual tables otherwise i could see it in tournament decks while red is popular and possibly when if blue steps in its place one zendikar block rotates out i feel that way considering most people are pretending to be the way they are and very very few are being sincere i feel it gives even more period feel and detail than sharpe and is certainly good enough to read cover to cover i feel like i have reached a plateau where im not buying as much as i use to and feeling more satisfied with my wardrobe and personal style i learned the hard way and after being here for about three hours you ll feel like you ve been here for months from all the friendly people you ll stop and talk to i feel that something wonderful is going to happen im getting is that since i feel that i accepted the mark of the beast when they shot me up and i thought they where going to kill me and i screamed so loud that i didnt want to die i try not to let their ignorance get to me if i have the energy and it feels important sometimes ill engage them in a little light debate and try and to broaden their view of the world i am going to assume a moral obligation to find a way to make sure i feel pretty damn rich every day i thought i would very sweetly cover over what i was really feeling and say something pleasant about all the bad things he had done whatever they were i have an ironic feel i dont feel anything special but i still smile broadly whenever he tells me something i really like him he has good morals and is very nice to me and respectful but its like i feel like i still belong to brad and i couldnt picture myself with eric because hes too innocent im so overwhelmed with feeling blessed by you i have to pray the fears of this being the last time i say happy birthday to you i feel very popular and also a little pressure to keep it up which is exactly what i need i took a chance and kept crying in hopes she might feel benevolent i liked that ros is not intimidated by anna s wealth and that anna doesn t feel guilt or superior about her wealth and that she enjoys it i watch her gather her little blocks and tuck them under her belly like a little red hen coo and cuddle her soft baby doll and look with interest at other babies i can t help but feel thrilled that she s our firstborn i feel like him try to stay as faithful as possible to what he perceives as the real events that happened in that mountain i feel glad to have my little blog to share with you the dangers i see on the path ahead i make punjabi lobia masala mostly during winters as i feel the protein punch and spice rich recipe is a winter warmer one i feel more joy and anticipation of all that is my divine right i feel thrilled to be able to investigate my own personal mythology around this subject i feel creative right now and it makes me happy i could wear on a casual shopping trip to feel fabulous without even trying i want others to be happy but does that mean i step back yet again it feels like and allow them to be happy because they deserve it or do they even deserve it or do i i feel so lucky to live in portland land of delicious food i folk if im feeling sociable i feel these divine forces so strongly sometimes i wonder if agnostics atheists and judeo christian fundamentalists have any feeling or excitement in their hearts i feel like ive been in a

under yours for me to feel safe again i am so relieved and excited and i feel confident again im proud of but having crafted something that other people care about even just enough to click through to makes me feel so wonderful i feel more clever i believe just imagining what it would be like to act live in front of an audience will make me feel joyful i hate the moment when i completely feel perfect with people around me whom i love the most suddenly disappear i feel really tranquil where i am right now i feel like after everything ive been nothing but sincere what bothers me the most is that you wanted to hurt me you even told me i feel like i should go to the supermarket and buy something totally delicious for dinner with the money my mother put in my account today i feel fine e terminando com eight days a week um ano depois i feel vital full of energy every day and super positive i mean how would you feel if euan got hauled in for murder but you knew he was innocent i have experimented lots of the experiences she mentions and sadly this made me realize that most women feel that their career paths are somehow going to be determined by their partners if they support them or not their children ther co workers etc i don t feel that talented at impacting how things end up at the moment i find myself feeling happy more and more and it feels so very good im feeling ok and

me i was wondering why i was feeling so ecstatic i use an elevated lexicon to feel more intelligent i will write anything if i feel passionate about it or at the very least if it genuinely interests

analyze i would feel joyful i kinda did steal joshua s customer i feel amused i feel thrilled with your presence in your eyes i feel the belief in peace in sincerity i don t feel successful if that makes sense i feel like my life is practically perfect in every way right now and i am every so happy i just feel like if i don t suffer to produce something then it s not worthwhile i was feeling creative i see you alternate version of me i feel like this shows the change that many countries have taken and that many countries are on the way to making this decision that includes supporting and increasing women in all areas of life i feel like it looks gorgeous with curls so instead of making the full transition i ended up getting extremely natural red lowlights on the bottom section of my hair i for one sit and stare at a blank computer screen for a while scratch my head a few times drink a couple pots of coffee and then feel triumphant once i write my first sentence and that first

to be helping him id feel better i watch hgtv and i feel like im not that talented i never feel brave and nor do i want to be as i believe that in order to be brave you have to make a conscious choice as to whether you want to be brave or not i express the gene of this dominant voice it feels rather wonderful as if i were really this writer this poet who was so carefree and crazy i feel very resolved yet somehow very depressed i feel like that s an acceptable favourite to have and yet nowhere can i see a terpene responsible for its flavour ive gained wieght but i really would like to lose pounds to just feel like ive finally gotten to an acceptable happy place i feel this book explains things well and is easy to use i feel pretty jolly i could look it up and act like i know what it is and lie to you about it and feel smug in my know it all ness but frankly i m way too lazy for all that i have something to tell you girls i finally feel brave enough to share the news i surround myself with bible verses that help me to transcend to a space where i feel safe and secure i slough off the carapace of crud that has enveloped me for the past thirty odd hours i feel invigorated and

think that you re the most gorgeous guy i ve ever seen and i love how other people disagree because i don t want them to see how truly wonderful you are to me i still feel like the admission that i don t like this popular show puts me in a category with people who kick puppies or people who or who steal the ratty clothes off the backs of dickensian orphans i feel like i smell this scent all over taiwan quite frequently in cute coffee shop bathrooms i guess it all just depends on my mood whether im feeling sociable or not im listening to right now because i feel like i need it and i want to share it with you little ones despite my convinced atheism somehow it never fails to make me feel better i feel so honored to be nominated for this award im feeling quite joyful today when i received the first year results as the first year had involved a lot of work and i was very pleased when i got the results i feel assured the world around me seems brighter i cant hide my feeling when i feel so glad i am ready to cry because i feel such a sweet presence of the ruach hakodesh the holy spirit in my room with me right now i attempted to call my mom to talk to her but she answered the phone with suck fake regard for my feelings she had her jolly voice on and i just told her nevermind and she said okay i have a couple guests walking through the door so i have to go and feed them some pie i have these random moments where i feel suddenly very creative and would love to sit down and hear the tick tick tick of the keyboard keys as my thoughts spilled out onto the screen i smoothly hand her a twenty feeling smug that they are both interested i feel like its the perfect time to enlist some extra help i don t know how i feel about today because part of me is convinced that i am making this so much more difficult than it actually is or as mehow casually remarks in the april infield insider getting out of the box you are in that was never there in the first place i was feeling a bit casual and put on a plain tank top with loose bottoms i got from zara i said i wanted to give you a little sample of the writing i denied you then but i m feeling a little more generous today i suppose because i just have to share one little taste i need to feel assured i need to feel secure i drove home i was aware of feeling not like myself and then she called to ask if i was ok i can feel it weighing on me filling my thoughts as i try to do homework or help out at special olympics i love the rainbow look that i have going on and think that it feels really festive i just hope the kids

across the exchange point feeling strong i really remember is feeling wonderful in the oatmeal bath ive clawed time back and i still feel strong i didn t walk the whole distance just sampled four or five stretches but i came home feel charmed by the experience i love feeling brave i wake up in the morning and have my voice and my throat feels ok but by the afternoon its all scratchy again and i sound like marge simpson until the night when its so bad and my throat is so sore i just have to whisper im going to sleep now while i still feel triumphant i also have a niggling feeling that im getting complacent in my abilities i feel combination slightly superior sitting in on virtual event you ll feel as if it s another day office i put up my christmas tree and im feeling fairly festive i

i can t ever been done before i tell people it feels like i am trying to convince people i am innocent but no one believes me i do not always find myself feeling thankful but over the years i ve gathered a few tricks that allow me to feel grateful in the face of moments when the last thing i want to do is say thanks im taking advantage of feeling artistic incase it runs away again bell had her baby the other day yay i feel like im actually supporting myself by making use of what i know and love i ask her what shed like to do and she just says she doesnt mind so i am always making

his or her own special way and find that the most attractive art is unleashed fromthe virgin artists i think the energy in our jobs and in our writing should not always be spent on what we think will sell but rather on our pet projects we truly feel invigorated about im even starting to feel more sociable i find it hard to feel jolly when throngs of people around me are so lost in the fervor of getting stuff that they cant see their heart for the green in their wallet encouraged by the constant barrage and pressure from every angle to shop here and buy more i think he feels pretty cute in this i got a bit caught up in the moment and forgot that at the core of the rude comments and silly songs were the real feelings of a beloved and brilliant comic actor and a very sweet and big hearted young woman i feel like an impostor in my work as i smile and talk about behavior contracts positive reinforcement cognitive reframing physical activity and other means for diminishing dissolving or deferring the pain of reality im told by horsey people that they are a rare find so i feel quite lucky i have not spent that much time with them but i just don t feel that comfortable there i feel

the curriculum to make lessons more enjoyable and interesting for the pupils i came away from this evening feeling very rich that i have a friend down the street that is so very close to me i feel like i want to punch him in his handsome face i feel optimistic that he ll settle in before too long once we ve arrived i feel im back to being that bouncy little chickie i was when i first found the scene but with a lot more depth and understanding of myself and the world around me i feel have been convinced by many factors in our culture of a kind of cooking mystique i feel delighted toward something it could be an acheivment i did or my surrounding or even unexpected event that happen to me i was insane not liking someone else to do all this but it made me feel less valuable b c i wasnt working and i also wasnt a housewife i feel honoured that she has chosen to share this with me i could sit for hours with some old friends catching up and just feel like i am in a uber gorgeous i feel cared for and accepted i start i feel like i should reiterate a fact that im not sure ive made clear yet just because i post all these despondent incidents on mermaidhaire does not mean that i am sad

life and family even though i belong to a middle class i feel satisfied with it i still feel completely accepted i don t feel so self assured i need to compete or to justify why i m so clearly not doing as well as someone else i hesitate to give out stars for any books because i feel that giving it stars is saying that it is absolutely perfect and there are no improvements to be made i still

the honor to be this precious little girls mother i asked them to join me in creating a world where all year old girls could grow up feeling hopeful and powerful i feel satisfied and happy with my

to be threw under the bus without a fight because youll offend someone if you stand up i wasnt feeling too well i notice myself worrying about him i push that feeling away and replace the thought with something positive or remind myself to let go its out of my control i feel super behind in all aspects of my life i need to read i really appreciate his protectiveness and slight jealousy over my attention it makes me feel valued i feel a bit like franz liebkind in the producers not many people know it but the fuhrer was a terrific dancer i feel like i need to cry these past few days and it relieved me that i could cry that much of tears today haha i wanted but knowing nothing about it i stepped into the candyland of make up looking haggard and left feeling radiant with a bag full of

talented of illustrators designers are ones that know how to get an idea across without the trappings of crosshatching and lensflares on everything i feel very privileged not only in being able to share in her artistry but knowing she has my back i remember feeling as if i didn t belong and that i wasn t smart enough cool enough or even young enough i feel hopeful and will do my best to give it

sociable these days i can t hate too much because i feel like she s looking pretty damn flawless in these pics i could feel the radiant heat of emanating from her naked sex reaching longingly for the probing tip of my hardness i know exactly how put out you are and feel like it is only really acceptable to foist that inconvenience on family i felt a very distinct feeling that told me everything would be ok and that all things would ultimately turnout for my good i feel really comfortable in them i feel more like the manager everyday and i feel more respected by the day as well i want to at

be connected with on so many different levels i hate the way mom and dad are to her i hate the neglect of her feelings and her needs as an intelligent child that are rampant in their parenting style i feel like as a creative professional you need to have that unpressed creative outlet to get re inspired i am feeling increasingly hopeful im feeling at my creative best rather than that of a student

career out of and looking for those all important christmas recipes to make this year feel a little more special i feel i had benefited more from last year s creative futures but could this be in part that the information i had learnt last year i was already putting into practice and therefore this year s sessions were what i was already doing rather than inspiring me to start im not convinced that

much more festive with the tree in i feel very valuable through you all i think i have a good feel for what players are feeling and i just try to help them to do one thing in life that we all want and thats believe and if you believe strong enough good things can happen washington said im really excited for her birthday but feeling super nostalgic about it i am feeling so festive right now and not

going on my own but i feel like a lot of people were in groups and a part of me feels like it would be cool to have a small group to hang out with i feel fine now but it was pretty rough running for hours and minutes straight im really feeling good i can feel the gap it feels like rich people status and poor people status i often feel that working in it is like being a hopefully benevolent goliath that is often undone by the humblest of davids i like to listen to it when the weather gets warm though because it makes me feel like i m carefree and at the beach ive collected as i feel its vital to create something precious from those items as a tribute to the earth and its power generosity im feeling peaceful and im happy that i dont have to do anymore scabi im in verona my final week

them i think you made them feel terrific i still am not able to remember a single dull moment a detail that pissed me off a thing i didnt feel comfortable about i personally feel that this is not a acceptable piece of art but i feel this does test personal moral and ethical views in people i feel like its not worth trusting him i feel like hed think that was pretty cool because i certainly do i

successful outcome had i explored new styles but kept it close to me and remained myself i feel as though sometimes i can be more clever than average i feel like hes sure of it ive been trying to tell you how i feelbut was never very smart i feel ok and go out into the world to work buy food or just go for a walk i feel kind of talented right now lol hmmm i remember the day i was on the phone with

coughing and spluttering all day long i did feel a bit like i was being mircowaved which wasnt an entirely pleasant feeling i was able to guess or pick up on a lot of the plot twists in this episode from the first hints we were given and whether thats moffat using really obvious foreshadowing or me having a solid grasp of his narrative logic im not sure but i like it it both builds suspense and makes me feel clever i mentioned above feel free to hit me up about anything i hope that i look back on this in the future and feel glad i documented all her small ways and feel if possible even more

sweet and a little bubbly i felt so good in fact i went to zumba half an hour later for an hour and then left there feeling even more energetic if that was possible i feel your motivation will be satisfied when you read this write up also who understands i am waiting for a feeling that special feeling that makes life easy and bearable i hardly feel that way m usually hyper and bouncy around

table at once should i feel the need to do so or conduct other useful air missions i feel a lot of positive intention behind it i do occassionally miss wearing regular earrings but i feel like my plugs have just become such a vital part of who i am that probably sounds so silly and youre rolling your eyes at me now haha im feeling rather inspired yet low i will enjoy my writing and even though i may be writing about morbid things i will find a way to make it interesting to read i feel glad to have mu tou cause only him can tolerate me and give in to me and massage my leg when its cramp up i feel honored to wear usa on my back i feel so determined this time and i say this time because i have tried every diet under the sun im feeling especially honored as my picks feature alongside some of my favorite designers like diane von furstenberg rodarte and jason wu i have the best conversations and the best time together unlike any ive had before but i feel like being totally in love with him does no good when he could care less about some stupid sophomore im just trusting in my feelings and im trusting god above and im trusting you can give this baby both his mothers love im continually feeling triggered im not sure if people are insensitive or if im selfish most likely the latter i feel inspired to get back to my indigo pot i feel wonderful and i m very very grateful for all the support i thought how great it must feel for the author to have created a story that has been so popular and now to come back with the story of the beginnings im getting things done that i really need to and i feel good about it i sing as one who feels contented with a comfortable life and comfortable christmas that includes general happiness about eternity i wasnt feeling like going on easter holidays i dont even know why at least i hope these days can be very productive for me i am feeling more creative now and am able to think outside the box a bit and am going to attempt a more adventurous eating plan this week i wasn t thinking negatively about any of those things often the feeling was benign or actually an excited anticipation i am feeling brave we will go somewhere further afield like a walk in the woodlands around a farm to the beach or some other full day activity i feel invigorated as i am one i am feeling brave and lucky kind of like my heart is breaking and im falling in love all at the same time i came away filled with admiration inspired by amy s friends feeling honoured to have been there to share a tiny part of their lives i write and share my feelings family events useful products good food exciting trips kitchen endeavors as well as occasional musings i have a feeling she is going to be an amazing artist like her daddy and uncles i feel wonderful monroe said upon the launch of her company im incorporated i feel like he is not so keen on the idea i become more comfortable in this remodeled office i am feeling much gratitude for its wonderful amenities i dont feel as carefree as i used to and this worrys me a tad i feel the corners of my mouth curl into a triumphant grin i feel free to create the definition of what i believe in rather than following a prescribed path i checked out the lyrics i realized that this song was talking about getting high and dreaming it supposedly inspires creativity and makes you feel real good i feel determined to offer her all the possibilities that my parents gave me to explore and create my own path i love running because i feel strong and powerful and totally in control i feel pretty fantastic i go fishing i really feel so carefree can i fish everyday i dunno how it feels to be completely happy the real world has taught me about struggle but what i m going thru is nothing close to

learning more about animals and the amazing things they can do just points to a wondrous creator i can feel them cool but seldom empty pale with i feel fine read the rest i do not feel that i could ever harm an innocent girl in such a way never have i imagined such dire consequences for not doing so ive been feeling really energetic at night and honestly i needed this ive gone for my k training

till the summer when we feel somewhat carefree once again i feel very passionate about this because of children reared within the evangelical church leave it before they are i thought of that feeling of delicious isolation i feel when i am absorbed in a quest each revelation leading to questions then answers then more questions a cave came to mind at first lined with ancient and wisdom filled tomes a deep comfortable chair and large paper strewn table in the centre i feel any artist that puts forth a piece of work even ones i do not agree with should be respected even if it s just for the sake of them overcoming the shackles of our society s norms i tend to lose feel for the water pretty quickly when im not in the water every other day and i felt this during the race i feel calm with her i guess a similar viewpoint might be when we feel smug or better than someone else im actually feeling a little smug id feel better later in the school year i told him it is because asians are very considerate so whenever a person is not feeling well they would have the common courtesy to wear a mask to reduce risk of spreading it to people around us i am feeling like painting tonight and simply being creative i never feel like i have it perfect sometimes i lean a little too heavy on the work which means more chaos at home and sometimes i lean a little too heavy on the home which means i get a little lonely and cranky i feel somewhat relieved but disappointed that of the two qualified venue i had questioned neither bothered to make the observations we did i will be thinking of each one of you i will be happy toast and feel my sincere huge magical group hug link rel stylesheet type text css href http jdelivery i feel that i have gotten to know the students pretty well and i talk

occasionally occur when i have no luggage especially exceptional luggage i don t feel superior to people who have made different choices or threatened by them i feel i am not that sociable enough thus for friends wise i guess i do not miss most of them i have a feeling i may be popular with the lady folk i will feel triumphant i feel if you re learning about your purpose and the workings of this universe and continue to evolve and transcend you will be productive and such along the journey i have been so busy i feel like i have free time at home i feel like it s going to be something shockingly amazing i read her novels to make me feel relaxed i feel like it must be a popular choice to have alterations done elsewhere i feel for the natives who welcomed me and others with open arms and hearts back then and wonder how they cope i feel as if she isnt faithful but i dont have a reason to should approach her or just wait until i have a reason to approach her i feel so jakun that amused me for whole minutes i feel like life is too good to be true i feel some super shifting some super circles i feel that we are often at the forefront of what soon becomes popular im still feeling quite lively i could feel safe enough doing so i wake up feeling triumphant i have noticed improvement is in the gabapentin and last nights dose of zonisamide which left me feeling very relaxed i started to feel super emotional all the time which was so strange im supposed to stay in the lively room but as an explorer i feel that the lively room simply does not have enuff to offer me and have decided to move on to the stairs bedrooms and baffroom i feel amused and kind of tired still in the morning i i forgot to take it yesterday so this morning i took two i feel super sick now i really loved the day which made me feel such gratitude that we were having such a wonderful day which made me feel very happy i would feel the speech is successful if its very uplifting and gives props to the graduating class i feel super glued to my bed i was feeling productive i experienced that feeling that people get when they are charmed or attracted to someone and that time was enough

received a raised eyebrow from a sensible member of the youth orchestra i am feeling a little adventurous so i will try to see if we can spook our pretty lady i do feel amused by all the different debates going on but on the other hand i felt that theres something missing i feel honored that you accept my invitation i often feel the need to defend just about anything even in casual conversation like blue s from the color code are usually christmas fanatics and i jump in and i feel so pretty and glamorous i asked feeling smug ive ever worked on and i feel very privileged to work with such an amazing team i can t make myself feel joyful but i can focus on the positive i feel as the author is very passionate about his poem because when he wrote his poem he wrote from his feeling and history i also feel proud of her i suppose thats wonderful because it means that they can learn so much so quickly and also make me feel like an idiot much the way i did to my parents when they couldnt figure out how to leave an outgoing message on the answering machine i feel about putting on brave faces fuck that let s get real i know and i feel that its time to wake up to be brave to change my perspective i mean i already did of course but i feel more glamourous naked now i feel decently intelligent i dont want to pretend i am someone and i am not because i dont feel comfortable i want to be positive in the morning i will need to convince my subconscious into believing i am feeling terrific i kind of struggled with it though and didnt feel like it was super powerful i finally realized that all i needed was to be and feel useful and blogging allowed me to do that i have been sneakily listen to x mas music since the beginning of october but now i feel as if it is a little more socially acceptable to prance around while eartha kitt s version of santa baby blares from my ipod i finished checking in bruce had already left and yiling was just leaving so i don t feel i had a chance to properly thank them for being so considerate and making sure we got settled in i did feel for her but honestly i was just too glad to have some kind of salvation from the merciless sun i didn t sleep well the night before and am not feeling half as brave as i was yesterday i also feel that the people in the village friendly and i do not need to be as alert as in manila though as the common sense rule still stays that is not to let your guard down i walk in the door to my house i feel happy i am left feeling happy about having the time to rest and take care of me but at the same time this huge sense of guilt builds up inside of me for not having respected our date for being an unreliable teacher a selfish friend i feel much better and without the help of ice i was just not feeling up to it for a few reasons but i am so glad to be back i was feeling super pressed for time the other day i did cut back on the amount of time i meditated but i didn t skip it altogether i feel everything is in control then i am ok i am feeling especially lively i have lost touch with the things that i feel passionate about i am getting less spontaneous am living by lists urgh i manage

you should stop and close your eyes and think about anything that you can hear or see or smell or feel its kind of a cool experiment i do feel like it is fine to have sex but you should be fully aware

at the end of yoga practice but also at the beginning or ending of a meditation or whenever i feel the need to offer myself an acknowledgment and reminder of my own divine origins i had it in the bag

mark i had got at the entrance examination and i realized my admittance to the university was almost certain i feel their pain and its not pleasant i feel very innocent and chaste now i feel like i have a plan that will make me happy and allow me to help my family better in so many ways i supposed to feel about a persom that i was wickdly in love with for so long for me who tells me that he will not see me when hes got a girlfriend because he can not be faithful to her if im around i feel you and its so sincere i did laps and now feel all virtuous i feel so assured and doubtful at the same time i woke feeling hopeful i also feel extremely blessed to be marrying into such a loving family i barely seem to remember where i live in the middle of coming to terms with the likelihood that i would just be single for the rest of my life and feeling pretty content about that i am now drunk again and feel fab i decided for the first time in about months to try not wearing my ugly pink and black running shoes and at least feel a little bit cute going out im feeling very mellow and relaxed sometimes im feeling productive and quiet and sometimes i just wanna have fun yknow im moving back into vegitarianism and it feels delicious the time when my sister had her first baby i was so happy and joyous because she stayed for two days after marriage before she had a child i was also worried about the long trip because i had vomited the night before and as you may guess im not feeling well at all i feel like i should try to calm her down shes been very good to me since the games ended but i can see katniss getting more and more tense with every schedule adjustment i am looking forward to it unless i feel out of place though i have been assured i will fit in i feel amused at the absurdity of it all i feel so much more productive at college and so to keep that productivity in full gear ill have to chalk up some ideas for art projects this summer train an army of attack pigeons and take over a tiny and uninhabited island i used to feel pretty friendly with started spouting off about how russia is running a muck for no reason that they dont give a shit about their citizens and that they cant be trusted i thought wed escaped the interminable bouts of bods in dressing gowns feeling each others lapels we now have the charming spectacle as i type of a guy in a tight fitting deep blue combo trying to for all intents and purposes take another guy in red from behind im being challenged and feel valued all the time i feel like i was actually productive today i did a breathing treatment but as i laid in bed i felt like complete crap and i couldnt sleep so i called in thinking i really need to get steroids and ill feel fine right i feel more resolved and less like smoking my lungs today are obviously not very happy with me im sure something will come to me on a day when im feeling a little more artistic i was feeling a little adventurous and ordered the seafood paella and lemonade and after the drink arrived i kicked myself as i should have ordered a glass of sangria i feel that people cannot possibly appreciate me that any compliments toward me cannot possibly be sincere or that i dont deserve compliments in the first place i began making dinner feeling good that i had succeeded in listening which resulted in a now cheerful husband i feel convinced that the ideal therapist who presumably should be able as a professional necessity to understand another person in his uniqueness and in his wholeness without presupposition ought to be at least a fairly healthy human being i feel like the class clown because im the only outgoing person there i have that spring fling feeling again and like a flower unfurling my artistic soul is ready for some sunshine i was feeling optimistic and actually ran the first couple miles at probably a pace i have now lived in virginia for about eight whole months and it feels super weird i didnt feel like moving around things were going just fine by themselves i asked zack if i could go all out and write what i was feeling and he was gracious enough to let me do so i get close to feeling what that is like is through dance which is putting music and motion together in a similarly creative way i keep feeling like i m reaching him this last time i was so convinced that he was there that he was responding that he was listening to me but every time it just seems to all come crashing down again i feel so glad i spent today working in my lawn and feel invigorated i have visited over other daycare options and it has taken me a year to find one that i feel will even be acceptable i feel like everywhere i look a piece of my sweet boy is missing i feel like pulling a paige from charmed just dont hurt me ok im thankful for music that makes me laugh music that makes me feel strong music that makes me believe in myself i much regret that i allowed johann to accompany me from khartoum i feel convinced he can never rally from his present descara i bring these to mind and feel the joyful laughter well up within my heart it becomes hard to remain weighed down by the heavier negative feelings i feel like i m going to be living a rich and sustained life throughout this year due to work i feel very carefree xd i feel are acceptable response times for non crisis responses i feel so peaceful so i know i made the right decision i again feel like going out in a friendly and safe environment i am booking a flight to pe i have done music and movie production in the last four years and i feel its time i do fashion which im very passionate about i feel like these lenses look so cute i am in front of a blank canvas i feel calm and focused ive had where i feel good enough to work the whole shift possibly the whole day i feel that every step in my plan has been taken with the divine help i feel talented sometimes i said sir i feel from real time company experience that mba would be more valuable for my career than gate since most work now a days in it companies now is support based i cant quite believe it but i feel more lively and awake ths morning than i have in ages i feel more inspired to get back into the mindset of putting the good stuff into my body i feel like posting something clever problem is of course im not an extremely clever person i feel a tranquil and eloquent charm his praise array delights me thought of legard but he loved me not i feel so rich when i pass by you i see a penny i love how a whiff of a certain scent can take you back to a certain time or place remind you of a certain person and make you feel content or nostalgic i hope the pair of us harbor no hard feelings and do enjoy casual chats about the ways our lives turn out without needing to press a title into everything i feel like the hood makes the sweater too casual to wear to work and so i just don t wear this sweater i can feel it clever of them and i feel invigorated when something is refreshed i have my lowest level class first which is definitely the most difficult to manage with the hotshot boys men then my best class very last period which leaves me feeling somewhat useful at the end of each day i was feeling anything but adventurous and stuck with comfort zone and ordered mcdonalds i do i hold onto them i look into their eyes and breath them in and i feel immensely deeply thankful i got lots o crazy shit going on but i am loved and feel hopeful about the future i was feeling quite something im not sure i want to enjoy this and feel successful i still have such a hard time writing my work down and when i do i feel its not perfect i feel i am seeing a series of intelligent people who have compartmentalised science and religion mostly into separate areas of their minds and not all in the same way and they are flicking backing and forth between them like radio dials i get the feeling that nellie is satisfied that the phone rang happy that leslie is out of the room now i feel respected and i feel like i am worth something i feel like im getting less intelligent more and more each day i know the feeling will fade away in a day or two or even in a few hours when the cute hairstyle starts to droop and frizz i dont have minutes to post something but because i feel like theres nothing worthwhile to write or anything that would slightly appeal to anyone who might read this i am feeling thankful for warm sunshine crisp autumn air and bright fall colors im feeling artistic and im feeling stellar i feel is truthful the fun always lies in having an idea and seeing it realized and not soo much in the object or goal i have to say however is that is is awfully difficult to feel glamorous and sensational in all this heat ash stench greasy hair and your basic post yeast infection mode i couldnt help but feel like that smug bastard on tv already called the first number on the ticket and it wasnt even close to what i picked i am feeling very virtuous today i feel that i have lived long enough i am leaving you with your worries in this sweet cesspool i am so incredibly thankful for the temple and for the blessings the promises and especially the feeling that comes over me when i am either inside this amazing building or simply when i drive by i feel myself so honoured i feel satisfied knowing the dirt and hair is no longer in the car and house i feel the need to have one day a week for those polishes im not super jacked about i want to get up in the mornings feeling excited about going to work instead of wanting to hit the snooze button i feel that way about popular culture i feel like a positive ball of inspiration i had to lose my best friends to be with the one who can make me feel forever contented with life and be eternally happy i can feel my self as a fearless continuous being i open the file im interested in and for about twenty minutes read fiddle and wonder why im not feeling creative im really just here to write whats on my brain if you want to read it and tell me im crazy stupid boring awesome genius then feel free i feel as though i don t write about them often enough but they are just cruising through life in their own equally special ways i feel better about myself almost tasting my success i didn t feel like i was popular but i did feel confident i would estimate that when i speak nepali i feel about as intelligent as when i speak english with german i feel about as intelligent and with spanish i feel about as intelligent i don t know i ve not tried a new character yet the universe feels much more lively than it did when i began so i m hoping that s true for new characters as well im just feeling relieved to have picked up our boy before they shut the place down and seized the dogs and happy to have gotten him out of there i really want to write and still feel like ive not been useful that day i dont want to put that pressure upon the minor because i feel like it would be more useful without it i started the dew beyond having a positive showing of the south to encourage writers from all experiences and levels of advancement to feel comfortable sharing their work i feel terribly like cassandra locking myself in attics and barns to write in beloved journals warmed by my ginger cat mine huckleberry and hers abelard i am pleased that only pgce qualified teachers can work here it makes the effort expense to gain mine feel worthwhile i answer feeling clever again i was going to be loved made me feel a woman like me could be valuable that i stood a chance there was more out there and told me that i could get over him it was a lazy bandaid where i didn t have to better my character i could just hope i feel still very honoured and i am deeply thankful that i was granted this opportunity i feel so much more comfortable with myself now that im not trying to dress a certain way that isnt really me i will tell you honestly that children generally can be very trying for me but when it comes to being a support to help them overcome circumstances and rise above it i feel my experience in that field is valuable and beneficial i alight in front of the hotel i can feel the bellmen s appreciative glances i didnt feel much like me but thats largely resolved itself i get depressed when i feel that i am not talented enough that i can never create a beautiful piece of art i feel that im much more productive i get less distracted and i feel so much more accomplished i feel ok an that kai can take the emotions that he will be feeling today i was feeling like a valued part of the family and there was a great friendly rapport between the three of us i can make and one that i feel i am called to make to my sweet jesus who sacrificed everything for me i feel ok much better and stronger than i did a few weeks ago im feeling generous enough to give the rest of my supporters ebooks too i am not feeling well or grouchy or lazy ill sometimes forego my bed in favor of our futon couch for a little shut eye i just feel so amazingly appreciative of my lj friends i know how it feels to find someone who is irresistable and remain innocent i was not able to say in a public forum indeed some of our most difficult struggles are left unmentioned i do feel that pleased that i was able to create some narrative unity in the experience we had there including some of the true highlights and challenges i feel really honored that i could experience the brazilian public healthcare system from the inside i am determined to lose weight the healthy way work harder in school be a better friend speak freely of how i feel be truthful with some people and get more sleep i was thankful to at least feel well enough to sit with my husband and kids at the table even if it was only for minutes before i felt like passing out which carson actually accomplished into his sweet potatoes no less poor guy was sooo tired i shall never feel like i am less than a valued human but i will always know that my needs can and will be met by gods people if i get rid of my pride and ask i dont know how to explain it very well its like i am happily bobbing along exploring an abstract universe all on my own but when i make contact with something i get excited and happy and i feel satisfied like ive formed a special bond with whatever ive encountered i remember being so disappointed with not showing for about months and now i actually feel like my less than lady like movements are more acceptable i feel lucky that there is this wonderful cheap cozy cafe in my neighborhood that serves this incredible mexican hot chocolate i find it very hard to feel relaxed for more than hours i might also write a bit about science if im feeling particularly energetic im feeling artistic today i was feeling very festive i decided to paint my nails for the holiday events i feel friendly when i hate you i feel theyre very cute and useful i feel like hes too carefree to be as serious as i want him i can fail so im feeling pretty relaxed about them i have the dried bladders all ready for a day im feeling brave i remember feeling as innocent as she looked that day i feel so self satisfied proving that i can get by without my car and i am not one of those typical americans who is so dependent on their car and foreign oil i feel deeply pleased as my hand plane takes off thin shavings of wood with a precision that is truly marvellous i really like the job so far and i feel like i am genuinely putting some good out into the world i feel like i m watching another copy of my beloved son created for the english speaking world being wonderful clever and delightful in new and different ways i feel so relieved like finally i knew what i was thinking how i was feeling i don t whoop and holler unless there s a special occasion going on but i was feeling suitably jubilant and a tad proud so out came the somewhat constipated yhhhay i feel about femme fatale except its not cute anymore now that its pretty obvious that britneys not in control of her life that shes so burnt out and yet i get the impression shes almost forced into this career to the point that she just cant or wont deliver anymore i feel like it is worthwhile to support local artists and so does clay so i am fortunate in that sense i have a feeling that christ welcomed corey and then whispered youve got some work to do son i hope this might create a generation of kids that learns to never fear sharing openly with people they feel safe with i had a feeling when i left that i just wasn t that relaxed enough to really do it justice i feel flirty playful sexy reckless i always dread that part of the meeting although dont think i didnt shoot my hand up into the air feeling all superior week when i lost i feel fairly calm i am also in an exciting space i have to admit i am feeling curiously excitedly optimistic about the future i may not be rich by material standards but i feel very rich because i am grateful for what i have i feel fab if i can get hours sleep in one go but sam doesnt always oblige i have eaten at many restaurants and feel that we enjoy the cheaper but much more delicious eateries than these more elegant but lacking in spice and flavor places im going to be talking a bit about how i feel about the important role of the fan in this wonderful game we call music i need to be intentional to do more things like that i think as a mom sometimes it can feel like you lose some of your personality b c as smart as my kids are their sense of humor is me making a silly face and chasing them around the house like a monster i was feeling joy happiness ecstasy triumph or love i felt contented somehow i wonder does anyone ever feel particularly inspired or moved watching question time these days i feel like im back to the arms of a beloved last seen a long time ago i not feel the tension that permeates the air in the calm before the storm i want or need to hear to make me feel valued i feel i don t need to describe how gorgeous the dominican republic was i ll let the film speak for itself i just didn t end feeling satisfied i used to think that men needed their women to like and respect all their friends and family in order to feel respected themselves i feel truly successful that brooklyn has been able to latch on and has had no problem going from breast to bottle and back again without skipping a beat i feel a bit more confident about them now so heres a gorgeous pair of cream amp lemon shorts i recently purchased in the warehouse sale

loved then going back to crying again i feel more free to enjoy the possessions i do have like this rock or that book or these clothes i didnt feel too much it was just casual i started feeling festive very soon right back in november and i suppose it was inevitable that i ran out of steam before the day itself im feeling all a bit hummpffff today you know so much to do so little time and its all going to be over in a flash i go back to my point about what an easy sell getting folk to feel really virtuous for not doing what they dont want to do anyway i know a lot of people are whining

feeling fantastic i complete the act i feel temporarily satisfied but the feeling quickly goes away and i feel ashamed or guilty id probably be okay wearing either of them as id have more fun making

be feeling some frustration if they didnt do the work nothing would be done i feel supporting herself and four i finally allowed my feelings up and accepted them and myself the internal boundary began to dissolve i began to see how i was projecting my suppressed feelings out and creating a lot of pain in and around me i cant shake the familiar feeling that ive got precious little time left i have

pleased with myself i spent minutes on the cross trainer and then two lots of minutes on the vibration plate just to test out the programs of course i highly recommend not just this song but the band

like a giant residential freezer flow with more ease through the teeny extra hole in my right nostril i code existed for the sole purpose of making stupid people feel smart i feel is probably the most acceptable strategy to finding out historical past it does not imply by any means that it is the only method to study historical past we must always have this subject clear i think the thing of it is

blessed to have such wonderful family and friends i twisted that to mean that i did not have to use them if i was feeling ok im a little worried because i feel the protagonist may not be likeable

are not needed i do love making them feel welcomed and excited about starting high school i feel like the cute little case is kind of hidden but i feel really bouncy for absolutely no reason and my

going to take one look at me and say you re amazing i feel successful as a lazy mom i feel like if you get something really cool you could easily turn it into a finished piece but that s kind of up to

and toes that is a residual of chemo that ive been told may take a year to resolve if indeed it does im zooming right through the second trimester and i feel fantastic just as i did with trinity i sing decently but coming from the kind of family i do i always feel like im less talented so ive never really tried to learn as such i only share what i feel is valuable information i feel like these words from today s passage send the church of today a warning just as much as jesus was sending his beloved disciples a warning i feel like there are so many years left to live when all i m contented with is to just lay on my bed with the lights off and listen to ayumi i feel super bad that thanksgiving seems to disappear more and more each year but i would be lying if i said that i werent excited for official christmas time ive also begun going through a round of self edits on the first episode of season three and im feeling quite thrilled with how its fitting together i feel respected and what i have to say matters i am missing some very important information or anything please feel free to post comments below because even though i have been interested in the style for years i have only been wearing the style and officially in the community for about a year and a half ive been feeling particularly thankful for my husband which is a sure sign i have a brain tumor or something terribly amiss with my noodle i feel really blessed i headed back to my office feeling satisfied maybe even a bit self righteous about how id consoled a friend i feel honored to have that kind of support i nuh must feel joyful and victorious i had a feeling it might be perfect for a take off on the tutorial i feel like you can have a piece for breakfast and its ok on the nutrition scale i feel that npr provides a valuable service i feel strangely calm for having everything literally on the line with this vote i feel like i can play with the work more than if it was trying to be some

for me giardina said i have reached the conclusion that what i feel is most important is what i think will most likely make me feel good or and keep away bad or unhappy feelings i feel that so many might be far too eager to point and say see that is not how a true trans guy should feel right now or see i knew trans people were way more fucked up than they let on look at this guy i always feel so eager to escape it though it never really leaves i feel that this is a very important subject to discuss i plan on making another post all about that but ive had some progress and i feel fucking fantastic i feel the need to knock one of my beloved darlings off of my list to make room for hugh laurie aka dr i now feel more intelligent about my followers myself and how i use a href http twitter i had already gone on my morning run with gyp and was feeling fairly energetic i feel really thrilled to learn i could leave spitak and come back after two years to the same town the same neighbors the same school children shouting my name and feel welcomed ive also made it with both sugar measurements but i feel like cup is just too sweet for me im desperately trying to stay away from black so i really am feeling proud whenever i put together a colourful outfit i am able to write a full letter in insular minuscule and i will probably never have the skill of xviith century writing masters such as maria strick or jan van den velde but i feel that learning a craft is a worthwhile effort in and for itself i feel really pumped and also am eager to try hiit high intensity interval training thanks to my new friend sarah i feel like if i train smart and take it easy i will be back to my former self in no time when i first heard i like you from my boyfriend i feel more useful to g this way i feel why i am not strong enough to let their negative thoughts and feeling not effect me i feel you i dont believ in you but i keep my faithful to you god gives me a chance to feel what is apathetic after it but much apathetic open up my mind that i can hide this feeling for you i know youre playing with me you show off your love like and maybe after it youll be gone will it happens i no longer

me phantomwise i absolutely cannot wait for september th to roll around i feel calm i suppose in my waiting im feeling mellow this morning after last nights debacle that saw me totally losing it with

thankful to her to get this opportunity and feeling very honoured today im starting to feel more sociable again i actually feel like going out and seeing friends rather than crying off because im feeling like a twisted knotted ball of pain i feeling im look a like those innocent lame hunting group old dirty hyena so not have any hope and ways to be free of dead i touch your skin feeling the cool glass within an image a mere reflection of loneliness alone with myself i think its fair to say that in this life we all want to feel sincere connections with other people to experience bonding through similar beliefs or experiences to have true synchronicity with the people in our lives i feel happy lite and very grateful i think she will have the luxury of looking back at her fashion moments and feel proud i reali feel glad im feeling fine just a bit nauseous and extremely tired but to be expected in the first trimester im feeling at the moment i imagine therell be something vigorous and active too i think you only ask for help to make me feel useful and help me gain some perspective i feel so lucky to be his wife and hope that i have the opportunity to remind him every day i was meant to feel sympathy for her but i have little sympathy for those determined to be victims and wallow in their own pain while blaming and punishing others for their state of being i feel like we re not a moonlighting type of show where all the tension is resolved at the end i work in a neighborhood school i do not feel respected or supported i can really truly only say that i feel that i am passionate about teaching i love my increased intense feeling of connection to the divine im sure ive got it right and my state of unencumberedness despite many years of feeling like i couldnt keep up anybody else is causing me to see my life as charmed i am and feeling total love and acceptance for my body in the moment is just as important as experiencing the exhilaration of a new experience i had to choose the sleek and smoother feel of the sweet revenge made drawing and handling the blaster a bit nicer i bring you opis im feeling sashy a gorgeous cool toned grey purple lavander creme i feel im not sure if ill do this again or not i love that they feel so comfortable with their friend im feeling dangerously truthful ive been here for the last two or three months and

youthful fun with ive done all my usual workouts and so i feel confident that i worked hard on that front i feel peaceful and not particularly stressed about anything i feel like i m too mellow in my regular life so i have no use for drugs that make me feel even more mellow i post this today partly because it s how today is and partly because i sometimes worry that my reputation for positivity might make people feel that my message is you should be happy all the time i feel precious little pressure to fill them with content with giving them answers that they can regurgitate at will i feel sure he is headed north i have not read any of the books but i feel sure that there is one man in the moon at least if not more ive come up with essentially tracks momentum gradually which i feel is as important as game to game results i feel divine forgiveness of all human frailties i feel like i still have some valuable information from that perspective i want her to feel worthwhile because she is i feel i feel ok and then i wake up i spend all day in bed or when im feeling adventurous on the couch because when i get up my leg hurts worse than my aching heart after titanic i feel i hate that cute patterns go out of print but similar variations of the same crappy skirt seem to last forever im looking at you simplicity i know you feel supporting an inept city manager who has cost the tax payers millions already with his bungling is important im not feeling real strong lately i naturally didn t know any fightstar songs they were catchy enough that i could feel like i knew what was going on and they were quite lively and they preformed fantastically well i like to think true beauty comes from the inside and that im loved for who i am on the inside but i definitely feel less valued and loved when i look like this i was driving i feel so contented after sadhana so fulfilled i was almost in a state of panic because i just feel like im not trusting people right now i read and appreciate all comments left but if you have any questions or concerns feel free to email me at contact i eat out at such hyped diners feeling satisfied but not extremely contented because the hype felt greater than what i have experienced i feel a little like a traitor to my beloved oppies but that said these clothes might just pay off a big chunk of my remaining debt and we all know that money is more important than ethics right i feel determined to give this process a label i can feel that they arent supporting me but that doesnt mean i dont want them im my life i feel strong style color black line height i feel im being generous with that statement im pretty picky with the folks i link to i only want to list sites that i feel are worth your valuable time i feel as though i gush on an on about the gorgeous colors of the produce we receive through our farm share and i have to do it again this week i feel really wierd about this we are suppose to be casual dating i want them to feel as if they are intelligent and able to make their own decisions i guess how this clouds your viewing depends on how you feel about filmic content personally i dont really give a shit what a film is saying so much as the way its being said and in this case the film is simply too great to ignore but its a sour note in an otherwise delicious orgy of depravity im feeling lucky button on google i like to know just because i hate feeling like the drama doesn t know but in this case i feel like there s so much territory to mine that i m content to enjoy the ride i am feeling valued and supported which is great i feel like a casual gamer i dare not say i feel ecstatic now but hey im feeling passionate about in my own home i feeling handsome q where is this lyrics from oh when you look at me like that my darling what did you expect i do not know what to do in my current space to make myself feel more comfortable i feel lucky every single day for it i can usually tell if someone is being honest i can feel if they are sincere and if they are just teasing i can t get past feeling like a poseur to become an advocate i was ecstatic to see that keiko zoll has done it im half asleep absolutely blissed out feeling as purely ecstatic as i know i will on stage tonight dancing out of the spotlight only to have it follow me like an adoring fan i do finally get some sleep i have the craziest weirdest dreams that make me feel like i didnt get any good rest anyways i realised karin s producing a book for those of us who feels keen but worries at the same time i feel ecstatic despite being tired i stepped outside and became annoyed because the temperature was warm and it was raining it felt as if the weather was conspiring to keep me from feeling festive i always had to eat everything on my plate and ate and ate and ate without feeling satisfied i am feeling fine today and felt fine yesterday i can make them laugh out loud i feel a keen sense of accomplishment im feeling pretty smug about going down yesterday instead of waiting i know about bigger kids than her so i dont take for granted that shell turn out any smarter than the average kid and i feel no need to tell her shes smart i am not feeling more and more freaking relaxed i wasnt exactly sure how i was going to feel after class but it was a gorgeous day and that helped with motivation i get the happy i can die now feeling and i honestly feel like if i died in the next few minutes i would be satisfied with life i have to say that when i received a gorgeous parcel of therapi skincare the beauty of the products absolutely took my breath away the lovely white glass packaging looks luxe but retains an apothecary feel perfect for an organic brand i really hope you like my card and feel

sweaty and feeling a keen need for the chinese food i d put aside that morning i kinda feel more relaxed with this blog than with the other one i would buy it again because it makes me feel pretty and the smell is divine i was really uncomfortable but i got over that because it did make me feel pretty once i put everything else together i love it i love doing it that way the pride and self satisfaction i feel when i do something by hand like that is a more pleasant feeling than what most other things in life can offer me these days i feel relieved when i don t have to play jeoffrey pagetitle eyo i think it makes the marathon feel more worthwhile i feel like sometimes i am not important at all i generally try not to worry about what others think or feel that im putting on a brave face for their benefit i also feel more outgoing which is strange because ive always considered myself to be more introverted but here ive been making more friends and putting myself out there more i

happy today me so i have weeded out the garden so to speak and it feels fabulous i think people are merely lacking of professionalism and ethics when executing their duties which gives rise to condescending attitudes feeling superior when all they do best is boiling water and being completely imperturbable when making mistakes which may be utterly cataclysmic to others ill be glad when shes all better cuz keeping ollie from fighting with her while shes feeling playful is quite a job i continually fight the feeling of jealousy for those who seem successful enough that they have legions of

the wall under the window feeling completely ecstatic and my cousin was next to me just smirking because she knew he had to be different from my other friends i look upon one of the main reasons

notion of being aware of how i m feeling in the moment and choosing between intelligent options now i have a hard time putting into words how good it feels to spend an hour serving as a friendly face to people who are oftentimes unable to leave home without the help of others i was hoping by then i would feel ok i feel like they ve just kind of coasted but they ve gotten even more popular i do

house their disappointments in hopes for the next season i feel fantastic now but am terrified of injuring my back again we provide our sizes for the following items i set up a consultation with a therapist last week and i went to see him today i spoke to him about my general feelings towards things and in the end he reassured me that i did not have atlephobia but instead i had social anxiety which is apparently really common ive discontinued this once seemingly integral method of self preservation feeling assured that i am the only theif in philadelphia i can t speak for anyone else but these activities have also helped me go from simply being okay with certain coworkers to feeling friendly towards them i feel freaked like im not safe anywhere i run i have to go straight out after work and need to feel instantly glamorous i will usually wear a pair of our nw skinnies with a pair of high high shoes i feel was smart as it avoided making the pages too cumbersome and additionally avoided the clumsiness of trying to introduce all the characters at once i wind up feeling like the butt end of some divine comedy and somewhere in the universe the muses are all having a good laugh at my expense i was feeling like death was knocking on my door in the living room and i would have gladly welcomed an epidural at this point i loved the idea of recording a large chunk of your life

glamorous i feel i have a lot of strong points concerning the economy unemployment debt and other options im feeling resolved i was feeling creative and making things better in my house i get to feel virtuous in comparison to him but i don t really have to put out i get the more confident i feel about being well prepared when i graduate i sat there in our living room feeling the sun come through the window cuddling my gorgeous puppy and cried i feel that is how we can be safe to be ourselves and trust i ask you how can they feel virtuous if any members of their preferred victim groups learn to take responsibility for their own lives i could feel the strongest connection and still can to my divine self i feel privileged to have the earthly father that i have but a far greater privilege is gods willingness to be my father i feel a sense of hope and optimism and i am resolved to allow myself to experience these emotions without regret cynicism guilt or embarrassment i need to be wise and

without being too in your face i havent felt like the real me in a while so the good feeling is welcomed with open arms i lived with someone living a lie to keep me in the dark feeding me lies and faking feelings so that id be ignorantly complacent until it was no longer convenient for her to have me there i sit in one of the rocking chairs and let my head clear in this seldom gotten alone time listen to the sound of the birds the barking of the squirrels feel the air shift from pleasant to chill i feel as though this class will still be useful because in the end when owning a business you have to spread the word of what your business is about and trying to sell or get done i feel cute and sexy all at once and its not so sheer i feel naked i am a good person or that how i feel is

effectiveness of the methods i reveal i sat in my feelings for a bit longer and the lord showed me some really cool truths that i want to share the fear of man is a snare but whoever trusts in the lord is kept safe i know that i love what i do but struggle with feeling content and balanced i need to know what her thoughts and feelings are this is not a casual play anymore for me anyway i sat in my room listening to everyone outside on the beach i didn t feel inspired at all i could just be who i am and feel accepted for being myself i walked out feeling so assured that this could really happen i forget that im supposed to be sad about being single or stressed about work and just smile and feel peaceful i just want to see him put more effort in making me happy and special and making me feel more assured i started feeling joyful again i could push those comments out of my heart and live joyfully again i do not have anyone that i feel comfortable enough to walk up to and tell the whole legitimate or rather illegitimate depending on the subject truth to i really didnt feel that much despite the terrific acting i love the midcentury design and the vintage feel i think this is going to be perfect when paired with their current dresser which right now is white but may be red after i get my hands on it i still feel the pressure to make sure they are excited by what santa brings i understand that this is a time when belts must be tightened but i truly feel that this is a worthwhile cost effective use of federal dollars and would much rather see it face budget cuts than total eradication i use it i envision how it would work if i had long thick lashes and i just have this strong feeling that it would provide me the perfect amount of lift definition and separation i feel like i have an artistic block right now and my artwork looks stiff and forced when that happens i feel satisfied when i am able to translate a funny idea in my brain i still feel the days are precious commodities dissolving away never to be seen again like a frosty ice cube melting under a glaring afternoon sun i love how i feel i feel satisfied without feeling bloated or lethargic i feel so amazingly blessed that my children have been able to take part in it i think im breathing again and every breath feels lively and full i feel reassured by how well we get on how much we love each other and i wonder why i ever worried i feel so peaceful to be around and myself im sure shes done some writing tonight and is past that amount now but for the moment i can go to bed feeling triumphant and also happy in the knowledge that i havent given in to writing absolute and utter crap just yet and that my story is progressing nicely i love the feeling of carrying him in my arms and

going to do with my day i need to feel useful maybe i can still contribute my time part time i dont want to let anyone down i feel like every day is special unique i feel like a harry potter fan trying to read the casual vacancy here im feeling positive today and tired and im going to make sure that im good with my diet and exercise from now on i think it makes me feel like the heir to an incredibly rich and diverse legacy of stories and experiences i feel safe and warm and there s lots of sunshine you d think i d get complacent i just want to run somewhere where i feel safe i feel a little brave and venture out of my comfort zone and into the kitchen i feel it is safe to say that i will send my first v and v for the matter before the end of the year i loved that he was still small enough to ask me for help to feel safe i feel that the fabulous apple flavor gets kicked to the side for pumpkin i leave the sooner ill feel better i feel like it skews the kids idea of what is cute and adorable and just encourages annoying behaviors i got a feeling however are still popular songs i get what williams is doing in imping other artists but i still feel that its more of a distraction than it is clever and the murder mystery plot is a decent hook but turns out to be wholly unsurprising i feel very out of place as well i feel ecstatic just to see you i am feeling as though i am doing something worthwhile and rewarding i dont feel the need to stay home and hide out with my laptop so much i feel their exuberance upon being accepted and i feel their pain upon being rejected i feel like ive ever perfectly captured this beauty this perfect girl i need to feel rich i wanna talk tell you about sycf it stands for singapore youth chinese forum btw and although theres a singapore word inside i feel like the minority there p ok but thats beside the point i love feeling productive and getting things cleaned out an sorted through i feel very contented just sitting beside him without even uttering a single word i feel edmontonians are superior to the residents of any other major city but if you ask me what keeps me living here despite my obvious hatred for the climate of the year then my response is family and friends i am going to print this and refer to it as often as i can so that when i feel things which arent so pleasant i can remember that now is the only moment i have to live in so make the most of it im not feeling like that to be truthful i am definitely feeling festive and had to paint my nails a little bit christmassy this weekend i also like

as yours i love to be able to say how i feel and i love to be in this complacent spot i am feeling super lazy no screenshots to guide you today p hence read carefully before you proceed i went to bed one night with my stomach in knots and woke up the next day feeling fantastic i feel a recipe is only a theme which an intelligent cook can play each time with a variation i think it will make for an

same enthusiasm i feel so happy when i eat something that i know i started from seed and cared for along the way i feel like ive had a pretty productive lazy weekend all things considered i have studied logic and ethics and i know with certainty that the motivation of feeling superior is not an excuse for judgement finger pointing and its eventual consequence hatred and in this case homophobia i took a little liberty here artistic license perhaps and went with a festive feeling for these as well i love hanging with the kids feeling calm focused and relaxed a burgeoning garden

made peace with why i lied in the past i feel that all music has some artistic value but with so much music out there is modern pop really worth investing your time in i feel that someone is trying to

partaking in a delicious feast these last seasons and now were about to get that last really fine meal i feel jolly i feel like someone who really should learn not to stress out because we live in an ultimately benign universe i can t even stand this feeling because i realize that everything is for nothing i will never be with you and i will never see you in my life it hurts but i keep supporting you i feel so proud and blessed to be carrying this baby i will probably never feel bouncy so feel free to remove that emotion from my selection i feel like a lot of teenagers including myself feel

control and out of my depth a thrill of adrenaline that left me weak and drained yet excited and inquisitive all at once i feeling more determined than ever to really nail this race i have thankful for being able to feel thankful after getting through hardship i realise my thoughts feelings emotions reflect my acceptances and allowances as a result of accepted and allowed programming and conditioning through and as time i needed to know i mattered that my feelings were important and that i mattered enough to be pursued and cherished and protected im feeling very optimistic about my stash reducing abilities this month too so you can expect a really big empties post next time i get in bed and feel thankful that i made it through one more day but then i have to get up and do it

think i ever weighed as little as i do now so im feeling pretty excited i feel like a little giggly schoolgirl but its all in fun i am feeling genuinely proud of myself i see myself behave in relation

like the most simple thing but its so eye opening i never thought id feel comfortable in but im just going to go for it and make bold fashion choices i desire something i am more likely to feel appreciative of it than if i feel entitled to it i am not feeling calm yet must act that way i just have to figure out how to really put it into practice without anybody feeling like their

like its not socially acceptable to do so right now i feel that wanatribe may become a vital link in my writing network i threw open my windows for minutes and then we were all freezing so i had to shut them and sat back and enjoyed that feeling of tranquility that only comes in those few minutes precious minutes when everything is spotlessly in order i feel these paints will be perfect for my

special and when i feel alone in this busy ever moving world i have a feeling his idea of keeping me entertained differs ever so slightly from mine jonny you i feel so thankful to be on their team i am sure that fans of every other team feel one of their guys got slighted and in the long run it really doesnt make much of a difference its just a shame that someone as talented as evgeni malkin was left off i feel that there s sometimes a danger of companies adding too much free stuff and slitting their own throats i don t feel like i am writing lyrics that are particularly special except that i am just hopeful that someone can connect with and get something out of what i m saying or writing about i am that were feeling more energetic and healthy overall and i swear weve been sleeping better

perfect for me and this love is for real i visited her this morning they had her up on her feet and she was sounding quite cheerful so im feeling very pleased i feel shame but i never change it it s sweet a la la la la long i ve been watching you jajaja s i wanted it to feel like all these fabulous people at an incredible party fell asleep and when they woke up the place had been a bit overtaken with lush florals and greenery i do jogless stripes even though its ridiculously simple to do i feel like i have super powers and have to oogle a while over the magic of it all i have some vague feeling anyway that it will probably be useful to us and if not then i could turn it into something useful i know that i sound like i m contradicting myself but i feel very satisfied with how i ve been doing at work i needs to get healthy i feel more lively and sexier than i have in years i feel like i ve been there and gained a sense of the everyday paranoia and the casual brutality of the time im feeling so popular today haha i persevered and km later im feeling pretty smug i am feeling fine all things considered i assert it is better to feel rich than to be rich i feel that way but yeah i do have a problem in trusting especially guys i left feeling thoroughly invigorated and ready to face a new year of craft challenges so big kudos to the wonderful organizers at hello craft for a truly awesome summit i did yesterday is very akin to carlas work in this book so i feel it could help strengthen my drawing in this area of playful creating and help me gain confidence i would maybe come to feel special about the person given time i also feel that seeing how the body reacts is an important step into changing the behavior i feel like it my beloved burkie who i miss more than words

pineapple grapes watermelon and berries add some fresh chopped mint for a cool refreshing flavor and if youre feeling festive you can even add a little liqueur like coconut rum or drambuie i feel super bad because i miss the blogging world miss reading everyones blogs miss documenti i was and am feeling honored to shoot for ffayths new collection im feeling particularly brave my armpits but

fashion juices into work with my vintage necklace and new bracelets like this bracelet from fleet i got a it a week ago and have wearing ever since i have a feeling that i should post some sort of

experiments and ingenious theories i want to believe its how my kids will feel whenever i become rich and famous and move on to the mansion that is waiting for me i open my eyes wide and i feel the

brave and wanted to try my hand at free motion quilting im feeling energetic this morning i hope that you enjoyed viewing and feel free to leave a comment i meant before i took some photos for a cube

mom from somewhere because she surely does know them i feel the cool in their wings as they brush my face and walk across my outstretched hand i dont know why i feel joyful that people went to my blog today and saw one of the entries i generally use this icon when im feeling playful or childish which is a fairly large percentage of the time im feeling a real casual day ill go for brown eyeliner instead i relaxed and nodded feeling assured that someone i love is safe and pampered even if he s no longer with me i venture back up north and for the big day i m feeling very festive i upset you over the last few days i m ok the clouds are clearing and i m feeling more positive i feel better i dont for a little bit i feel that california democrats a little too smug in their safely liberal

child i feel so wonderful i am feeling generous at this time i will answer your questions i bought some eggs and because i was feeling adventurous i also got a whole chicken and an oxtail i allowed people tonight to make me feel as though i was far less superior to them because i felt less attractive less popular and less able to be part of a community i felt happy when i received the letter telling me that i had been admitted to the university i still need to brush my teeth but i have already taken my pills showered and eaten breakfast so i am feeling virtuous for a moment or two i feel

and i quickly finished a small scissor fob i feel very contented and happy upon seeing him i feel delighted to showcase this journey i get frustrated with the fact that i don t always feel appreciative for the hand i ve been dealt and for the people i love in life i haven t felt in the real life such as the feeling that comes after the successful adventure etc i could feel julia hesitate as she wasn t yet convinced she should talk to this woman i wound up with something lodged in my oesophagus which didn t feel pleasant to put it lightly i don t feel a lack of respect or love in the space just harder partying than i am personally comfortable with i was feeling quite clever at that point and i had not had even a drop of wine i have been feeling pretty fabulous for me that means my pain is about a out of for the past three days i still feel like a butt but thank you for being so gracious i feel triumphant and even thought it may be just a fleeting moment i am enjoying the power of motherhood im feeling really good and i know im getting stronger but i am also waking up early and working hard almost every morning i had always dreamed of doing and it was a good feeling a fantastic feeling to be able to give them this i feel like if i could just go to detention after school for a couple days then everything would be ok i get that feeling of confidence is far more pleasant than some of the alternatives and i certainly am not against someone increasing their confidence but why do you have to feel that first before you take action i was not feeling the song but i was delighted with his re emergence i am a runner probably i would really feel far more safe in the title i feel that the students will be more successful in the classroom i feel so privileged

shoots one or more of those down i feel invigorated even though it is caffeine free i dunno how else to describe how great i feel i swear ive been giggly all day i feel like im going to be way more successful a writer because of it i am feeling and how much i am trusting god varies enormously i feel like thats not useful or fun at all so i will replace those exotic icons with a destroyer i will go to the supermarket and feel up tomatoes and hope life imitates art and some cute guy will ask me out i feel pretty virtuous about it actually when i won an unexpected sum of money i want to feel carefree for one last day i feel like i finally entered or accepted that i ve entered the mother part of life i feel so virtuous writin my morning journal like here i am in a jane austen novel which is aided by the fact that mr gs computer is on a kinda i was i might be buying stuff from there but i feel the clothes are too casual i feel pretty lucky to be able to experience it again in this way

superior i do feel that the more intensely intelligent a dog is the more socializing they will need i feel when i see them because i have such a jolly time when i hunt in england or that i like to roam around england looking at the pretty doors and the old pubs and talking in a british accent but these cards tickled my fancy im feeling particularly carefree i have hawaiian bbq chicken pizza with chicken bbq sauce pineapple and onions i cannot speak for others but all i know is i feel i am the most successful prettiest version of myself when i walk out of my starbucks with my red cup

fabulous with my jacket and shoes aint no bitches gonna bring me down hahah i am feeling contented and pissed at the same time im a big guy and ive gotten into some of the rigs that weve worked with to try them out and see what they feel like and let me tell you it was less than pleasant i really am not feeling child friendly i like to think i present myself and the life and times of the working mum to a good standard and if i ever do miss a apostrophe or miss spell a particular word please feel free to call me on it i feel proud to know several people that have deserved to be advanced for a while now and finally picked it up this time around or last time in a few peoples cases i thought yoga was supposed to make me feel tranquil peaceful and sculpt my legs into those of a greek goddess i asked some girls what it meant to them to be valued and for the most part the response was that they felt valued when the people around them made them feel valued and treated them in a loving and caring manner i wasn t the person who was helping i realized that it was i who inspired all these people to start charity work and i can t help but feel proud i feel so amazingly overwhelming thrilled for my wedding i find it relaxes me and i feel productive making food as the end product should taste nice and will satisfy myself and other people i didn t feel talented at anything i was doing and eventually wasn t putting fully into it i feel for all of you who have been supporting me is so extreme there would be no way to put a number value on it i do feel proud and happy and also very grateful to all who read me im now on day two of the plan and im feeling positive i feel as if today was a positive gift delivered to us teachers on a very stressful week i will tell you that i am feeling quite invigorated i fancied the terrains there and feel keen to go there again i am feeling triumphant today i come in contact on a regular basis and the sooner i can figure out how to be kind to them in all situations the sooner they will feel valued appreciated loved and the desire to learn how to pass that kindness on to others as i am learning to do i seem to share an equal passion for long distance touring and harley davidsons so i feel sure wed bore to tears every person within earshot i don t know if it s mostly because he s forcing himself to be distracted or if he s feeling more determined or what but i think that though he s still hurting he is learning to cope with it kame takes a breath i feel a little glamorous i wet the brush i don t think we re to that point yet and i foresee a lot of traffic between my bed and the crib until he is old enough to no longer feel that i am the only acceptable answer in the dark i could empathize with tab because of raging hormones and the connection feeling like someone else gets you thinks youre smart pretty worth attention i feel so totally invigorated that i completely forget what it s like to have a cold i tell you that i love you and my feelings are sincere my dear i wanted to thank them all for giving jordan and myself the chance to be together without any distraction and making us feel so welcomed and loved i have spent of my waking hours enjoying the freedom of not owning a cellphone feeling smug about it in situations in which a phone would have been awfully convenient and fielding incredulous questions i don t like feeling like an eager schoolboy waiting around for hours just to touch the shining alumninium i have finally cast my studio show and it feels fab i feel that passionate about i felt this emotion when my name was announced on the radio that i had been selected to come to lilongwe school for health sciences to take a training course as a medical assistat i was feeling superior to women who left their alcoholic husbands i was stronger and more godly and wasnt ever going to do that i didnt have to drink as much last time as people who get ultrasounds at weeks or before do but it was still enough that i was feeling distinctly eager for the toilet by the end i feel it is perfectly acceptable to consume homemade chex party mix for breakfast during the holidays given the fact that it is mostly cereal i feel like they don t think it s sincere when it really is she told us exclusively i feel my comments or opinion are sincere but some people get the wrong message i feel like charmed gave me the means to spend those few years when my sons were very young at home with them ive left the orange scented mixture white but feel free to color it if you wish i always appreciate them and please feel free to become a follower and come back and visit again soon i left feeling satisfied that donna knew what she was doing and i was in capable hands i could have done more but i was feeling a pleasant tiredness and had a good sweat going so i stopped at that i feel like im super rich kinda like when i could drink goldschlager haha i didn t and still don t feel lucky though i am on so many social networks right now and sometimes i feel like that i am pretty talked out i feel like i should have some sort of rockstar razzle dazzle lifestyle but i would at least like to spend a third of my life doing something i feel is worthwhile i feel much lighter clearer and more energetic ive come to feel about a supporting character in one of my all time favorite films giant i was really struggling to run with the discomfort i was feeling but was determined to continue as the crowds on the bridge are massive and i didnt want to be one of the first people they saw walking or stopping i feel like this beats out just about any popular high end foundation on the market at either ulta or sephora i like doing reviews and i got this from target a few days ago so i feel its acceptable to review this for all you makeup lovers i feel quite pleased with these little bits of news so i will celebrate tonight with a meet the brewer event hawkshead with some of my members in one of my newest pubs i woke up i feel thankful to god for giving me another day to go on i feel like it is so important for me to publicly bless my virus i feel thrilled that by the end of the month this round will be completed and i can begin to recover i wish there were more times when she just needed me to hold her and rock her to sleep because those are the moments when i feel most successful as father those times when im able to meet all of her needs just by being there for her i feel so relieved and happy to realize what is being said i do not feel assured i feel i m handling it well and i m enjoying it he said im not feeling the jolly this year though i feel special excitement and happiness i got a great pump and halfway through the workout i started to feel fantastic i feel happy about the outcome of this long election and im glad its over i feel they are one of the most talented teams in the nfl but for some reason people feel like there s nothing to really fear against them i feel welcomed into the barn like a son coming home i wish i had the right language to convey the simultaneous feelings of excitement peaceful enjoyment of country cycling but also being out of my element i also got some very nice condiment type pressies whilst at our local garden centre today so i am feeling that i have achieved something towards the festive season im not constantly horny or always feeling playful i feel like the crows and roosters will be teamed up with the horses and go against the bulls sharks and other monsters that are trying to take over of cool ranch i still feel too chub to wear the cute summer clothes i had dreamed of i feel it is acceptable as this is not everyday food i was lucky enough to feel and squeeze myself to a win in another festive challenge which involved a box full of items that we had to identify by blindly fondling through a hole i feel like i m not pretty smart interesting enough for my boyfriend and that he would feel more stimulated or happy with someone else i feel is that the most likeable characters aren t important enough to the plot i like in this world and making a list of them always makes me feel joyful i feel very saddened that the king whom i once quite respected as far as monarchs go was ineffectual at best i feel more energetic i feel very honored in how much he has shared and expressed with me and that he trusts me i just feel that if i end our marriage he deserves a truthful explanation i feel as though most people will find it quite pleasant i believe that with our minds focused on the daily rat race our bodies simply forget how to feel vital and free a classic case of you lose what you dont use i typed up all my blood pressures for the month but i have a feeling hes not going to be too pleased with the lack of missing information i am now feeling delighted but daunted i admire her and feel like even though shes gorgeous and talented she hasnt succumbed to the hollywood pressures like a lot of a listers have i have a feeling that its too sociable i am feeling stronger recharged and excited to get back into my runs i do think that if a husband feels greatly respected by his wife that will draw him to her and make it much less likely that he would want to flirt with other women im gestating one and feeling pretty thrilled about that i feel terrific in every one of them i aspire to capture the manner in which i feel this tension is resolved and why austere and introspective training still has a place alongside study of the method at euskc i had a ton of fun at the thrift store and i feel like i got some really useful pieces and i can get in on current trends for cheap i honestly wish christmas was celebrated in the summer because i feel like i tend not be as jolly as i wish i could be i guess it comes from believing that when i was younger anger was not a feeling that was acceptable so i tried not to have it i am pleased to report that i in many ways i am feeling well i have now and feeling like people think it means im just ok and dont need to talk about jeremy anymore i feel slytherin is my house slytherin is for those who are smart enough to know how to get the job done and at any cost i didnt react with the way that i really feel im ecstatic for your marriage to tonks i don t really know the oldest one very well and his mothering mother seems to feel that he is not sweet i know she shes the only one who provides income to my family right now but it feels like shes putting it up in our face that shes supporting us i feel like i m superior to the human race rel bookmark permalink i feel more assured having made my peace with atheism im feeling more lively than yesterday still not sure about food though im feeling my way often blindly from the carefree days of youth into the uncharted waters of maturity aka the midlife crisis here i explore transformation via one of my favorite things the tracy anderson method i feel like the leadership training was a perfect vision of what god wants missionary work to be now im feeling really outgoing and i get with a really quiet person and i try to make them feel comfortable i was feeling fairly keen i feel like im better amp able to do things it comes back i am feeling currently but as with anything when it s all resolved feelings will change i feel i am appreciative i take care of the baby i try to keep the apt clean as much as possible and i try not to call him a million times to find out when hell be home it varies from day to day as he is sort of self employed so its hard to plan things around his schedule i dare myself to do the following when i m feeling brave enough i feel eager to do well and i feel like ive got more titles in me he concluded ominously im feeling quite positive in what i want to achieve i have a family i can feel passionate about and completely comfortable with i feel that this is for others to decide hellip i m delighted that fans of my paintings will now be able to see a body of work of which i m very proud ive never done a detox or cleanse before and i really had no desire to i feel like cleanses cycle around and become popular every couple of years and id pretty much written them off i came to utah freaking out about not knowing what i was doing with my life feeling less worthwhile because of not going on a mission like every other girl and just being stressed by the daily stresses my life has lovingly given me im feeling excited about it i had a feeling that he would be the one eliminated but wasn t completely convinced his cooking skillz were da bomb yes i m whipping out the early s lingo i just cant help but feel like i must protect this innocent being i feel his gracious presence even now i wanna feel that gorgeous body a yers underneath me next time i m fuckin ya alex took a deep breath and her eyes seemed to glow while she imagined the scenario in her mind a scene she had pictured many times before i feel makes the perfect duo i feel any better im lucky enough in life to meet someone who makes me feel safe happy secure and loved i feel theres no reason to wait i would feel productive im not feeling jolly in the least i take photos of but i suppose since i feel i am least talented in the area of portraiture i most admire that ability in others i feel like i am actually a creative person now i am feeling pretty excited about this i feel more optimistic about everything than i have in a long time i am feeling joyful every part of me feels happy and light and whimsical i feel so relaxed and happy when im in the water i feel like i am the world for this boy and im glad that for a time i can be that for him i don t know about you but i m feeling amp blessed im feeling fab thank you so very much for asking i randomly heard this and ever since then watching the video has been a delight and the music just makes me feel as jolly in reference i feel satisfied that ive made the cut off you can only receive overflow money from stsm if you are over and i told myself that im just going to wait for the overflow instead of trying to hit and help my team i rarely feel happily joyful and dont walk about smiling much i stand in front of mansoor s works i feel obviously that the artistic intention is not to raise the already raised questions of structural linguistics and the deconstructionist clamours that followed it i would do almost anything to have that feeling back and those days back they were carefree and wonderful and now everything in my life is just so complicated i guess no matter how much i think im feeling ok im as nervous as hell on the inside about the scan revealing something i dont want to know again i could feel how much slower i was on the treadmill but the pace was pleasant and after six days of relative inactivity i was just happy to be running again im feeling generous so there you go with that golden nugget i could feel productive during his treatment i am doing this and makes me feel more determined to give it some effort and dig deep when im feeling the pain i might hold a sense of satisfaction at feeling superior and giving advice i do think gt that for those who desire privacy and the camp out feel they would be gt terrific i rarely respond to the comments made unless i have what i feel is a very important and specific reason for doing so i never feel like anythings getting resolved with my counseling so i just drift away i swear and i mean this if the browns fail me tomorrow night and make me feel like an idiot for not trusting my gut feeling that they are going to lose tomorrow i m not picking them to win again all season im feeling generous this week i feel that this experience has convinced me all the more that we need prayer for our country im feeling optimistic to finish out these last two weeks strong and probably continue with what i have been doing im feeling just a little bit pleased with myself ive also been for a run which im feeling particularly virtuous about i really feel and i know the devil hates that its always been something he could use against me and im determined not to let him i feel for them when things happen and i get excited when things work out well for them i am feeling ok for my biostatistics course by my physiology course will be touchy i feel the need to explain myself and my thoughts in ways that are clever funny or maybe even insightful i would suggest volunteering to help people in need such as at the salvation army when you help others you learn to appreciate what you still have and feel worthwhile i woke up feeling fine i wasn t feeling well but no specific issue i love how my customers leave the studio looking automatically refreshed and radiant and now with the product line everyone can feel gorgeous and confident i feel like this is a way i can combine all of my creative outpourings into one thing im feeling just a little proud i am back to feeling determined i am off on wednesday to a postgraduate open day but there will be plenty to write about the rest of the week i feel sure i already feel him kicking my ribs making it harder to breath sometimes and taking over precious space where my stomach once was i am really excited because i didnt really stand out a lot in high school i was just slightly above average and decently friendly and i feel like delivering this speech will be a cool legacy i can leave on the school i also tried after all that frustration when i was feeling none too energetic for more problems to work on the respirometry stuff which is going to be a huge nightmare i feel even more determined to keep up our once per week tradition that my son started i feel the need to compensate with only the most perfect jacket as a topper to cover where my boobs do not fulfill their duties i feel like it might just be ok i am feeling so hyper and bouncy i know i haven t met most of you in person but i feel so honored to be able to come together with you as we grow closer to god im feeling especially brave and tough ill have to tell the story of scattering his ashes i feel so contented with my job i feel useful and valued and that is fundamental for me i feel so relaxed and happy and i have discovered that i love having projects that take a few months to do but in the end i will have an actual product to show for i like the fresh feeling of sweet he gave me i feel so wiggy about everything maybe ill just drop my virtuous lib stance and join georgie porgie ive posted ive been feeling the casual vibe when it comes to dressing i feel honored to be part of the culinary community here i feel like my fish might be moderately more intelligent than most fish as ive noticed they have a tendency to go to the corner of the tank closest to the container of fish food and just stare at it i was feeling clever so i changed the last line to cookies for you i feel like even though things arent quite resolved with my major i have peace about it still i don t know about you but it makes me feel generous im already feeling pretty festive this year even though its only november i feel should be determined by me and my actions and nobody or nothing else i litsen to his music i feel so much pride to think i gave birth to this amazingly talented child who one day when he was in his early teens picked up a guitar and just played it like it was second nature i am a prolific writer in my fandom but do not feel that i am as highly respected from fellow writers as i once was because i do write so much and as often as most people cannot i feel honoured that such a great man claims me as his friend i said at the beginning i have combination oily skin but i still use this around once a week because my skin feels absolutely gorgeous the morning after applying it i am not feeling so generous and he is sent to the sofa where he glares at me for the next six hours i firmly believe that the only way to go about this craft is to write the book that you feel passionate about and not to worry about finding the book that the mass audience desires i feel as though i have merely accepted what has been done and that no matter what time has gone by it will always be with me i was an year old girl who just wanted to feel important i used that word just to feel the energy of anticipation as people prepare their delicious meals and gather their needed tools for when they invite their loved ones into their homes i see people who physically resemble me i feel confident to strike up conversations with strangers i dont know it if is the freshness of both but i feel more energetic during these seasons i feel he is a terrific actor i felt it had a slight bitterness in the finish that detracted from its oily mouthfeel and sweet entry i woke up and felt sad all over again but that was quickly replaced with a feeling that reassured me things will work themselves out on their own time i feel like he s a lot more playful open with me than other girls i know he s friends with i feel very cheated since i am supporting the family and doing all the other stuff while he spends hours a day gaming i continue to feel so content about our decision to move here i kinda get real attached and excited when i feel that way and i never handle things as well as others would i almost didnt even feel convinced by the way the book was written im feeling brave ill snatch him to on my lap and after a few seconds of struggling he completely relaxes and submits to mommy scratches i feel sure that i will go beyond that i feel like i am less of a woman less of a person less valuable because im not married and not dating i am feeling content and happy with myself i feel like we re getting a terrific recruiter basketball coach and person im feeling adventurous i might even make it multiple tiers too i wouldnt say that i suffer from social discomfort at the moment because ive found places where i feel comfortable and even people who have accepted me the way i am i was feeling cool that night and she got it right i feel special a href http facsimilogos i feel pretty strongly about not doing a giveaway to gain numbers i feel really honoured to be a part of this inaugural race and you can sense how proud the local runners are to be able to show off their trails and to host this event i even dare to try to explain in words how i feel about this gorgeous boy who is here at my house every other day holding my hand through lifes dismays i feel like ive come a long way and im proud of what ive achieved not only this week but this year as well im feeling hopeful relieved i feel it is of vital importance and stress we show love towards one another and genuine love please people otherwise feel free to go cold on me i do not like being misled i feel a bit calm now i was feeling brave i would try to pick up running again i walked under the refuge feeling it was the perfect shelter from a storm i blamed the people around me for making me feel less valued for being a stay at home mom i didnt get to prank anyone throughout the whole day cos i was either too busy or not feeling creative i wish him and i could go out and i could do my hair and makeup and feel cute and flirt and talk and stuff but that never occurs i am feeling particularly optimistic today and have every reason to look forward to amazing things in i feel that books are always a wonderful gift for a baby i feel ok that must be the reason why it was so outrageously priced i really do feel superior i feel like that line is so perfect im feeling so appreciative of every experience in my life that has brought me to now to today i always feel that love is something much vaster and if we could explore it together perhaps i should then make my life into something worthwhile before it is too late i stopped myself and began telling myself what i wanted to feel i am peaceful i feel like i have nailed the marriage and the house parts of my life and i am happy and content as i can possibly be in those aspects i just tell people i feel like one sweet southern mess right now i feel calm and okay but sometimes i just get so sad i received a slightly belated message back from daniel and feel a lot more reassured that im not the only one who thinks l is emotionally insensitive i work myself like crazy doing extra stuff around the house or volunteering and serving other people in an attempt to feel productive and useful to someone anyone pleeeeeease i am feeling so appreciative today i declined to purchase any this time i enjoyed feeling squishing and project thinking all the divine yarn i feel much more relaxed going into this race i feel this needs a clever title but i cant think of one i felt like id developed feelings for this guy thus explaining why id even follow this guy like a faithful puppy dog and he never knew i feel like nine times out of as long as you re determined and keen it tends to work out anyway i feel that it is of vital importance that those who care about me know this stuff i always buy a couple of pork loins when they go on sale and when i m feeling clever i cut them in half and tuck them into gallon size ziplocks with a marinade and stuff them in the freezer i dont know but i feel virtuous so i accept the reward i feel like i can t truly get excited for this race because i have no idea whether or not i ll even be able to run it i feel elegant in a dress i still feel like there is a lot left to keep me entertained i write this i giggle and shake my head in humbling shame but in a way i feel somewhat triumphant i write this th post i feel extremely delighted to buy myself a little corner in this blogger world i don t know how else to describe it except to say that i had the same feeling about three weeks before my beloved grandmother passed away i know the feel of her losing control against me and trusting me to catch her when she comes apart i said before do feel free to contact me this is something i am interested in finding out more about i feel myself about how successful my attempts are im starting to connect with the fact that people want to hear music not perfection whatever that is i feel like he has a very pleasant nearly transparent presence on lobelia though that presence was necessary nonetheless i have this grave feeling it will not be back until tomorrow and strangely enough i have accepted it i had been blessed to be running it for the th time how could i not be feeling anything but thankful at the many gifts this race had given me i know it that sucker is overhead and i feel triumphant i plan to do so by obtaining an mba and from that mba program i feel that the most valuable outcomes i would like i feel these days living in fears just another way of dying before your time so today i am declaring myself fearless im feeling all jolly and warm inside but i just feel empty im sure i will feel fine in the morning i feel is the most important question how would we handle this i feel so pretty in them it doesnt matter how un glamorous the task is i could feel the sincere enthusiasm of all the people who got involved in this project i know for a fact that he treated everyone this way his love seemed boundless but he also made me feel important i love a hearty chat where i mean everything that i say and laugh from the heart gut w e not because i wanna let the person feel im entertained i have that feeling that spark and i am not sure where it is going or if it will ever turn into that flame i soon realized that an initial attraction to an activity that feels playful is often followed by a desire to practice to perfect the talent that led to the original enjoyment i feel as though it is worthwhile and career wise i still feel like there are more than enough to keep me entertained while still being just a few to keep dusted i don t always feel like i have amazing style and most days i choose comfort over anything else but there is one thing that i feel makes all the difference in how i feel about myself and that is makeup i havent needed the pain meds maybe i will chillax with some wine feeling all elegant like i feel virtuous and tough when i wear a hat jeans and a tshirt without worrying i feel so eager to prove to my friend that im not like that i breathe into the feelings in my body resisting my mind s clever attempts to analyse what i m feeling ill likely post more on those later but feel free to ask if you have questions i feel so amazing musicjuzz i feel so giggly reading your comment tags i do that made me feel excited about life i am not feeling as terrific as i have been i feel quite glamorous in this dress i am feeling a lot more positive about the future of the virtual birth unit and simulation in midwifery education i feel so very keen to leave the country atm i decided to actually paint this piece in a common canvas because painting in canvas make me feel very artistic i feel so peaceful and happy i thought maybe once i started running i would feel ok i chance that difficult to accommodate with the feeling of a jehovah and benevolent lord i don t have the feeling of divine vibrations i feel so lucky that i get to experience this joy at sssas every day i feel your frustration but it s time to calm the hell down i slowly realized that even the next day when the six hour effects had worn off i was feeling more energetic and could concentrate working through emotional crap better i feel the presence of the divine with you when you are buried inside me smiling down at me your sweat dripping into my eager mouth i entered the office though feeling the monday blues with a joyful and serene spirit dominating i feel productive and active but i have the balance i need i feel so glad that im able to have the time to spend some time with my family now i feel watching him grow into a self assured life loving boy i had the feeling that it might not have been taken as the truthful and sincere compliment it would have been i feel like im working with half of my voice caleb and i make it through a really wonderful night at the comus inn i feel like some of you have pains and you cannot imagine becoming passionate about the group or the idea that is causing pain i feel comfortable here there was a huge niche market waiting to be explored i can remember feeling that relaxed was last summer on the boat i am not sure how i feel i think because i felt like i already knew i have already sort of accepted it im feeling a little more hopeful about the future of my career i feel is an acceptable and significant modernization to the storyline not a detraction i feel underappreciated and under valued i actually feel halfway benevolent i like being in church on sundays it makes me feel more virtuous how self effacing and more settled for the week ahead i am thinking is the fact because xanax slows your system down it allows you to feel very relaxed but also it might leave you with a not enough energy and motivation i guess it could be described as me just not really feeling like i m a part of the popular bands the up and comers or the growing local band i am on top of my game and my fingers feel strong and loose i never dreamed i would be so busy so soon in the new year but i am loving it and feeling so very gracious and fortunate i feel reassured by their behavior on this matter and will definitely continue to do business with them i feel bouncy and i could easily run out there few hours i dont really care and i dont feel proud of myself at all i don t know what to feel as in i am not sure should i feel sad cause it is ending or should i feel glad that it is over and i can move on i do not and they see that nice words keep a heart feeling wonderful i got into the house feeling fairly calm the photographer is weaving his way in and out of bridesmaids doing touch ups my dad is telling a story my mom is running in and out of the house i manage to go through my list before the bridesmaids start clamoring for the dress im feeling good these days and my only complaints are that its getting harder and harder to move around and chase after stone and its getting harder and harder to find clothes that fit i feel gorgeous yes i feel that bassanio is sincere about wooing portia i was gaining weight getting a lot stronger and feeling amazing im feeling playful a href http i check you when you re sleeping feel your nose and toes to be sure you aren t too hot or cold i also feel it helped the newbie bloggers

about it right now i m feeling proud and scared and a little sick i think that s adrenaline though i was feeling more optimistic with blue skies no wind and temperatures hovering at about degrees i also feel the need to mention that the animators at pixar sure outdid themselves this time i was feeling playful that day and replied with a lighthearted bit of banter unwittingly replacing her question mark with a solid check mark my voice was just right for the funny yet informational for dummies series i feel it is really valuable to contemplate on that phrase thy will be done in all of our lives i wasnt feeling sociable i really wasnt i feel that i am useful to my people and that gives me a great feeling of achievement im feeling more comfortable with derby i feel as though i can

never stop feeling thankful as to compare with others i considered myself lucky because i did not encounter ruthless pirates and i did not have to witness the slaughter of others i had lunch with an old friend and it was nice but in general im not feeling energetic i feel that it is something that will never really be resolved i feel as if i am the beloved preparing herself for the wedding i have found in the past when i blog daily i have more to say and i get out my feelings and emotions in more creative ways i am feeling very blessed today that they share such a close bond i feel really special and important i have a feeling hes going to be way more successful than i am i love this song and it always makes me feel happy i feel a special draw toward and awed admiration for the firefighters who led the charge into the towers when everyone else was rushing out i didn t feel accepted i feel energetic and excited to see my results at the end of the week i feel perfect with you on facebook href http www i hope he will pull out the tissue paper himself but i feel like to him sunday will be just another day to be cute and wonderful i have a feeling that was because we opted to shoot more photojournalistically and completely prop free which is a personal fave of mine i must say to get to this point where i feel nothing but just friendly feelings towards him takes alot of time i feel that this is important in itself the fact that we all have our own individual way of grieving i feel in perfect height or just height threads picture images i feel ecstatic and light as air i would lie in bed and feel it somehow sparkle and i knew that even if most meningiomas are benign mine was growing and needed to come out sooner rather than later i feel like the people i know

though i somehow feel glad shes now in malacca with me my younger sis i know jack and he doesnt give up on men easy he just dumps them when he feels successful i was feeling calmer and more trusting on his restraints that he was helplessly trying to remove i have just moved here and already i feel welcomed i feel is most important and an issue often glossed over in education and clinical training is the mental health of the therapist i was feeling very pleased with myself for having resisted the very strong urge to buy fabric i feel most vigorous while inspiration and motivation grip at my consciousness are also the times when physically i feel most dispirited i definitely succumbed to pre holiday sales but i feel good going into the holiday season i probably shouldnt say that though

net for new exciting recipes i will be happy when someone i know from across the internet feels happy as well i feel that the content i have in mind isnt really that great after all im now winded at

the calm beginning to return i say this mostly because i wasnt feeling so well later that evening i feel like ive been so inspired and have been stretching myself in all kinds of directions but finally feel like setting down and going with the flow i feel happy about this i feel like our society has programmed little girls to begin dreaming of having a prince charming a big wedding and a happy family at a very young age i manage feelings for prince charming and the boy i realized that clothing is made in all sizes and i do not have to look like a model to feel more acceptable to myself i feel very privileged you did and i hope you stay awhile and comment if you want to i feel successful in balancing my paid work and family life or i am satisfied with the balance i have achieved between my work and life on a scale of to i was feeling fine im feeling less adventurous im feeling generous lets make that winners and i feel what i m thinking so she can be reassured about what she means to me i love your style and feel very comfortable with your writings i feel like the popular kid at school i have angel alone and although i feel a little more relaxed i know im still stressing majorly about travelling tomorrow and all of the things we need to do before tomorrow i feel reassured that if something happened to me my guests would be able to easily get the help they need i am beginning to feel like a fabulous adult i feel the cool night air against my face i feel as though that talking for a month is acceptable but please pretty please get together after that i dont know what it is about me and sweets they make me feel bouncy and pleased with everything i did find myself wondering just how her stepchildren may feel about featuring so prominently in the book their relationship with valente is not always peaceful and harmonious and she does comment quite frankly on how they made her feel on occasions i knew my dress instantly last time because it made me feel special thats the reaction i wanted this time too i feel invigorated when i look at this image just as i did when i looked at the other two photos i almost feel as if i am paving the way to the more pleasant memory that prabhupada saved me and that my life now is real im feeling good i increase im not sure why at i still feel as if i need to be socially accepted i do wear diapers once in a while but only when i m feeling casual i feel like this semester has been good for me im lazy my characters fall into categories of smug and or blas people and their foils people who feel inconvenienced by smug and or blas people i dont want to say the word problems and i feel like i know these will probably get resolved but man i think it goes back to never feeling accepted when i was growing up a learned internal diatribe i need to let go of i feel innocent on summer nights i feel more and more convinced especially after a very rough last year that finding someone you love and who loves you wholeheartedly in return can change the course of your life and give the spice and emotional support to live it i feel it my solemn duty to warn you ive begun my fall semester and i feel thrilled i think i may be feeling sociable im back and feeling creative i type i feel bouncy and excited to get out my ideas i experienced a v drink today which is supposed to give you boundless energy for a while though full of the cold as i am i didnt feel bouncy though h noticed my speech quicken after minutes or so i will help you in setting the table picking up the dishes after we finish eating and if i feel particulary charming on that day will not pick at my food search for lizards in your house or come out looking green to my gills after having used your restroom i know i dont normally share other peoples give aways unless i feel very passionate about them i love feeling carefree and without all these nervous feelings shooting through my body like i just saw myself on americas most wanted i was able to feel pretty i yori aoshi and possibly other stuff brought back a lot of old forgotten values and feelings i had towards a relationship if anything the innocent feel to it where nothing is complicated and its just about being with each other i was feeling playful so i made a little snowman he was only about feet but i thought he was cute i would have depressions and feel like a burden to my husband who is supporting us i know what i want will take next semester but i feel entirely too complacent i remember sometimes feeling relieved to be around my

triumphant smirk at my back i know what it feels like to be the popular boy band on top of the pops looks like were heading in one direction i feel like i should also mention that there was some content that i wasnt thrilled with either i didn t feel ecstatic after each workout or anything like that i think i should ignre this feeling for the sake of our precious friendship i log on feeling vaguely sociable and after a short amount of time im all socialised out i feel brave again tubing were even going to try ice climbing in nipigon and dog sledding i started out feeling amazing i it seemed like forever i want to put my phone life in knowing loving feeling seeing believing trusting and caring for her i do feel more productive when the sun shines i feel for goes far beyond artistic reverence i feel spiritually invigorated if physically tired im feeling the christmas spirit so it seems like the perfect time to mention an idea ive had swimming around in my head i can say is that despite my occasional jokes to the contrary i feel its vital the modern reader understand that not every german was a devout nazi and many in fact detested the partys ideology especially academics and those who were forcibly conscripted into service like gunther and company i feel ok about this work because it is not so bad and it is not so good im feeling terrific and in great shape im optimistic

dont agree with this neo religious terminology or practice as i feel if one is to be faithful to a certain custom how is it believed that say a year old modification in commandment will be just as or more bona fide and sacred than its original gesture i was and championed me to feel and be fearless i am feeling pretty confident that on monday i will get up and slip in to the water at masters swim

ecstatic i feel it is a vital sentiment that should be cherished and further nourished for every seconds of my life i feel that getting the word out about free software is at least as important as

now i also get to dig up happy memories hidden back of my mind and i get to become inspired with hope for the future i guess this is a memoir so it feels like that should be fine too except i dont know something about such a deep amount of self absorption made me feel uncomfortable i have to be overactive and stressed out to feel like i m actually doing something useful i feel that i am not valued i am under paid and worked like a slave unfortunately this is not just a personal feeling i have also been getting back into my gym routine so im feeling positive about this now i couldn t help

i feel betrayed because i admired him so much and for someone to do this to his wife and kids just goes beyond the pale i feel practically virtuous this month i have not exceeded my target of only buying things i also feel valued as a whipping girl for him to take out frustration and anger on maybe to a bit less of a degree than i would like i feel confident that you and i have something solid

glad to have the aid in the back to prevent me from running back and forth to people who required help constantly i guess i could have done so many things before giving up i suppose i feel so content with loosing that like with the rest of things that should matter in this world i just dont care i have would be that common ground but i always feel like i m a casual observer rather than an enthusiast im starting to feel graceful oh happiness i can finish even if i have to eat and feel satisfied bellmont cabinets before it leaves bellmont cabinets a wipe out on the spot it is not necessary to wipe out for when you o i could feel every muscle in my body working as one to move with grace i know me graceful power and control i looked at him feeling quite amused and relieved i feel more well rested though my sinuses still hurt and my voice isn t quite back to normal i feel as though my time is not valued i called myself pro life and voted for perry without knowing this

support people close to him i feel vaguely cheated and a little amused i am feeling pretty wonderful i feel when i am thrilled with my hair i have an extra bounce in my step and i don t worry about my

moon wired giddy i wrote feel there rather than think or believe because i know objectively that i am smart probably smarter than most people but most of the time im more conscious of what i dont know than what i do know i had been feeling fabulous and full of energy but easter weekend wiped me out and i havent been able to recover i feel im supposed to hate dams amp all the control of nature that they represent but sometimes they really are the most elegant amp awe inspiring structures i constantly worry about their fight against nature as they push the limits of their inner bodies for the determination of their outer existence but i somehow feel reassured i feel its important to share this info for those that experience the same thing i truly feel that if you are passionate enough about something and stay true to yourself you will succeed i feel like i just wanna buy any cute make up i see online or even the one\n",
